    "query": "For how long a portable/mobile x-ray unit must be used in one room to be categorized as a fixed x-ray unit? does this include mobile fluoro units like c-arms? what would be the difference in terms of physics testing, if a mobile x-ray unit be used in one fixed room or carried around in multiple areas?",
    "answer": "Direct answer: A mobile/portable radiographic x-ray system used continuously for >1 week in the same location is deemed a fixed radiographic installation and must meet fixed-installation operator-protection standards; Article 175 does not state an analogous \u201c>1 week\u201d rule for fluoroscopic (e.g., C-arm) units.\n\nDefinitions\n- Mobile / Portable / Stationary \u2014 Mobile: wheeled base; Portable: hand-carried; Stationary: installed in a fixed location. (\u00a7175.08 \u201cX-ray equipment\u201d definitions, p. 25).\n\nOperator protection & \u201cfixed\u201d threshold (Radiography)\n- Threshold that triggers \u201cfixed\u201d \u2014 Mobile/portable radiographic units (excluding dental/podiatric) used continuously >1 week in the same location \u2192 \u201cfixed radiographic installation\u201d. (\u00a7175.46(h)(2), p. 41).\n- Once deemed fixed \u2014 Must meet operator\u2019s-booth standards for fixed radiographic equipment. (\u00a7175.46(h)(2) referencing fixed standards, p. 41).\n\nFluoroscopy / C-arms\n- No 1-week rule stated \u2014 Article 175 does not specify that mobile C-arms become \u201cfixed\u201d after a duration of use in one room; instead, it sets mobile-fluoro technical conditions (e.g., image intensification required; beam must be intercepted; minimum SSD). (\u00a7175.53(e), p. 44; not specified for a \u201cfixed by time\u201d rule).\n- Mobile-fluoro additional requirements \u2014 In absence of tabletop, maintain SSD \u226530 cm; image intensification required; beam operation interlocked to receptor; broader source-skin-distance rules: stationary \u226538 cm, mobile/portable \u226530 cm (with limited surgical exceptions). (\u00a7175.53(e), (p), p. 44; \u00a7175.47(d)(5), p. 37).\n\nUsage restrictions (when mobiles are allowed)\n- Routine clinical use limited \u2014 By July 1, 2022, portable/mobile x-ray may be used only when transferring the patient to a stationary installation is impractical; routine use is prohibited except: hospital ER/trauma and non-ambulatory inpatients, plus patient homes/LTCFs. (\u00a7175.04(c), p. 23).\n- Mobile service operations (e.g., van-based) \u2014 Separate registration required with main location address, configuration sketch, and safety procedures; does not alter fixed/mobile categorization by time. (\u00a7175.42(a)\u2013(c), p. 39).\n\nPhysics/QA & surveys \u2014 what changes if \u201cfixed\u201d vs roaming\n- Initial QA & room survey (registration stage) \u2014 Facilities mandated to have QA must submit a QMP initial QA report covering all tests required at any frequency for each unit, and a radiation-protection survey for each room housing a radiographic unit; this becomes applicable when a mobile radiographic unit is deemed fixed in that room. (\u00a7175.40(d)(2), p. 36).\n- General QA program (diagnostic) \u2014 Facilities (except dental/podiatric/vet) must maintain a facility- and equipment-specific QA manual, perform QA tests per the manual, correct deficiencies, and keep records; this applies regardless of whether a unit is mobile or fixed. (\u00a7175.12(b)(1)\u2013(3), p. 28).\n- Fluoroscopy acceptance testing \u2014 All fluoroscopic units require QMP acceptance testing (covering all tests required at any frequency) before clinical use, except mini C-arms with II <6 in.; no distinction based on room permanence. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43).\n- Operator-protection differences \u2014\n  - Fixed radiographic: exposure control permanently mounted in a protected area (operator\u2019s booth). (\u00a7175.46(a), p. 41).\n  - Mobile/portable radiographic (not deemed fixed): operator must stand \u22652 m from patient or behind \u22652.1 m-high protective barrier, not in primary beam; personnel monitoring and \u22650.25 mm Pb protective garment required. (\u00a7175.46(h)(1),(3), p. 41).\n  - Fluoroscopy (including C-arms): follow \u00a7175.53 technical and dose-management provisions irrespective of room permanence (e.g., AKR/cumulative air-kerma display for post-2006 equipment; last-image-hold; resolution tests; patient-dose management for FGI). (\u00a7175.53, p. 43\u201344).\n\nDosimetry/monitoring (when mobiles are used)\n- Radiography (mobile/portable) \u2014 Personnel monitoring required for all operators of mobile/portable radiographic units (excluding dental/podiatric). (\u00a7175.46(h)(3), p. 41).\n- Fluoroscopy (any location) \u2014 All individuals working with medical fluoroscopic equipment must be monitored; badges processed monthly (quarterly allowed only for mini-C-arm-only workers). (\u00a7175.17(e)(4)\u2013(5), p. 32).\n\n> Not specified in Article 175: A time-based rule that converts mobile fluoroscopy/C-arms into \u201cfixed\u201d status.

    "query": "what are the rules for image quality testing of mini c-arms? is it required like normal c-arms?",
    "answer": "Direct answer: Mini C-arms (fluoroscopic units with image intensifier sizes less than 6 inches) are exempt from mandatory acceptance testing, including image quality assessments, prior to clinical use, unlike normal (larger) C-arms which require comprehensive QMP-conducted acceptance testing covering all QA tests such as image quality; however, facilities must still maintain a general QA program that may include image quality evaluations for all fluoroscopic equipment unless otherwise exempted.\n\nDefinitions\n- Mini C-arm \u2014 Treated as small-SID/extremity fluoroscopic equipment under general fluoroscopy rules; specifically exempted if image intensifier (II) size <6 inches. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43).\n- Normal C-arm \u2014 Larger fluoroscopic units (II \u22656 inches) subject to full fluoroscopy requirements without the mini exemption. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43).\n\nAcceptance Testing (Including Image Quality)\n- Requirement for normal C-arms \u2014 All fluoroscopic units (except mini C-arms with II <6 inches) must undergo QMP-conducted acceptance testing before clinical use, including all QA tests at any frequency (e.g., daily, monthly, annual), such as image quality assessments (resolution, contrast, etc.), per manufacturer specs or Article 175; report verifies tolerances, and non-compliance must be corrected. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43).\n- Exemption for mini C-arms \u2014 No acceptance testing required for fluoroscopic mini C-arms with II sizes <6 inches prior to clinical patient exams; this exemption covers image quality testing as part of the full QA suite. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43).\n- General QA program applicability \u2014 All diagnostic facilities (except dental/podiatric/vet) must maintain an equipment-specific QA manual, perform QA tests (potentially including image quality for fluoroscopy, like resolution and low-contrast detectability), correct deficiencies, and retain records; this applies to mini C-arms unless facility-specific exemptions are noted, but no mini-specific QA exemptions beyond acceptance testing are stated. (\u00a7175.12(b)(1)\u2013(3), p. 28; cross-reference \u00a7175.53 for fluoroscopy QA integration).\n\nDifferences from Normal C-arms\n- Image quality testing scope \u2014 For normal C-arms, image quality is explicitly included in mandatory acceptance testing (e.g., verifying manufacturer tolerances for resolution, noise, uniformity); mini C-arms skip this pre-use verification but may still require periodic facility QA checks under the general program if the manual specifies them. (\u00a7175.53(a), p. 43; \u00a7175.12(b), p. 28).\n- Ongoing QA frequencies \u2014 No modality-specific frequencies for image quality tests are detailed; facilities must follow their QA manual, which for fluoroscopy should align with \u00a7175.53 requirements (e.g., last-image-hold verification, which indirectly relates to image quality); applies uniformly to mini and normal C-arms post-acceptance. (\u00a7175.53, p. 43\u201344; \u00a7175.12(b), p. 28).\n\n> Not specified in Article 175: Detailed protocols, frequencies, or specific test methods (e.g., phantoms, metrics) for image quality testing in fluoroscopy, including mini C-arms; these are to be developed per manufacturer tolerances or QMP guidance in the QA manual.

    "query": "what are the requirements for interlocks in radiography and fluoroscopy rooms?",
    "answer": "Interlocks are required for radiographic operator booths (door/panel interlocks) and for fluoroscopy systems (barrier/receptor interlocks preventing x-ray production unless the barrier/receptor is in place); Article 175 does not mandate general room-door interlocks for diagnostic rooms except as an alternative when doors are not visible from the booth.\n\nRadiography \u2014 Operator\u2019s booth interlocks\n- Booth door/panel interlock: If a door or movable panel is used as part of the operator\u2019s booth, it must have an interlock that prevents an exposure when the door/panel is not closed (\u00a7175.46, p. 41).\n- Room door not visible from booth: If any access door to the room cannot be seen from the booth, either provide an \u201cx\u2011ray on\u201d lighted warning sign outside that door during exposures, or implement an interlock that prevents exposures when that door is open (\u00a7175.46, p. 41).\n\nFluoroscopy \u2014 Barrier/receptor interlocks\n- Primary protective barrier interlock: The x\u2011ray tube must not produce x\u2011rays unless the primary protective barrier intercepts the entire useful beam (i.e., x\u2011ray production is interlocked to barrier position) (\u00a7175.53(e), p. 44).\n- Automatic termination on barrier removal: The exposure must automatically terminate if the primary protective barrier is removed from the useful beam (\u00a7175.53, p. 44).\n- Mobile fluoroscopy receptor interlock: It must not be possible to operate a mobile fluoroscopic unit unless the useful beam is intercepted by the image receptor (i.e., beam operation interlocked to the receptor) (\u00a7175.53, p. 44).\n\nNot specified in Article 175\n- A general requirement for diagnostic radiography/fluoroscopy room entrance interlocks beyond the operator\u2019s booth provisions above is not specified.
