If the registrant is required to have a QA program pursuant to §175.12(b)(1), and if the \nmanufacturer’s specifications are not available, the registrant’s QMP or RSO must establish \nspecifications for equipment use and document the specifications in the registrant’s QA Manual.  If \nthe Department finds that the specifications present unacceptable tolerances, the Department shall \nrequire the registrant to utilize new specifications and shall notify the registrant of such in writing. \n(b)  All functional x-ray units registered by the Department shall be subject to inspection by Department \n\nstaff, or by individuals directed by the Department to inspect such units, such as CRESOs.  \n\n(c)  Radiation safety requirements. The registrant shall be responsible for directing the operation of the x-\nray system under their administrative control and must assure that the requirements of this Article are \nmet in the operation of the x-ray system. \n\n(d)  A current copy of NYC Health Code Article 175 must be maintained and readily accessible by the \n\nregistrant either in hard copy or electronic format. \n\n(e)  Registrants required to have a QA program pursuant to §175.12(b)(1) must have a written radiation \nsafety program as part of their QA program.  The radiation safety program must include, but not be \nlimited to, the following: \n(1)  that the use of ionizing radiation within its purview is performed in accordance with existing laws \n\nand regulations.   \n\n(2)  that all persons are protected as required by this Article. \n(3)  that upon discovery of a medical event (as defined in this Article), the registrant must follow the \n\napplicable requirements of §175.25 concerning notification to the Department. \n\n(f)  If an x-ray system does not meet the provisions of this Article, then the registrant must correct such \n\nnon-compliance, or initiate necessary corrective action, within 30 days of such discovery. \n\n(g)  Individuals operating the x-ray systems must meet all licensure, training and experience qualifications \n\nrequired by the Department. \n\n(h)  A sufficient number of protective apparel (e.g., aprons, gloves, collars) and shields must be available \nto provide the necessary radiation protection for all patients and personnel who are involved with x-\nray operations. \n\n(i)  The registrant must use auxiliary equipment designed to minimize patient and personnel exposure \n\ncommensurate with the needed diagnostic information. \n\n(j)  Neither the x-ray tube housing nor the collimating device shall be held during an exposure.  \n\nExceptions may be allowed for Department-approved devices specifically designed to be hand-held in \nthe area of patient dental exams. The Department shall maintain a list of hand-held dental units that \nare approved for clinical exams in New York City, or may accept the list of such hand-held dental \nunits as approved by New York State Department of Health, at the Department’s discretion. \n(k)  The useful x-ray beam must be limited to the area of clinical interest. For x-ray units not utilizing \n\nPBL systems for clinical imaging and not using cones or diaphragms for beam restriction, the clinical \nx-ray field must be less than size of the image receptor on four of four sides of the image receptor.  \nFor all digital image receptors, the size of the clinical image must not be digitally manipulated as to \nrender its original dimensions different from the clinical image size when the image is archived. \n(l)  Consideration must be given to selecting the appropriate technique and employing available dose \n\nreduction methods and technologies across all patient sizes and clinical indications. For registrants \nutilizing manual selection of technique settings for clinical x-ray exams, this means a technique chart \nthat employs technique settings for thin, average and heavy patient sizes. In the case where children \nless than 18 years of age are radiographed, the minimal technique setting should correspond to \npatients of 1-years old,  5-years old and 10-years old for exams most likely to be administered, e.g., \nAP chest and  abdomen exams. In all such cases, the Entrance Skin Exposure (ESE) must be directly \nor indirectly determined for all clinical techniques set.  At a minimum, these technique charts along \nwith ESEs must include: \n(1)  patient's (adult and pediatric, if appropriate) body part and anatomical size; \n\n49\n(2)  technique factors; \n(3)  type of image receptor used; \n(4)  source to image receptor distance used (except for dental intraoral radiography), and \n(5)  position of the grid for the x-ray exam, i.e., the grid is either removed from the x-ray beam or  is \n\nin the x-ray beam.  \n\n(m) A facility must have a documented procedure in place for verification of patient identity and exam to \n\nbe performed, including identification of the appropriate body part. \n\n(n)  The registrant must create and make available to x-ray operators written safety procedures, including \ninstructions for patient holding and any restrictions of the operating technique required for the safe \noperation of the particular x-ray system.  The operator must be able to demonstrate familiarity with \nthese procedures. Patient holding must be restricted to radiographic examinations with the exception \nthat holding of patients shall be prohibited for all fluoroscopic exams and patient CT exams with the \nexception of hospital emergency rooms and hospital trauma centers. \n\n(o)  The registrant must restrict the presence of individuals in the x-ray room of the patient being \n\nexamined to those required or in training for the medical procedure, or the parent or guardian of a \npatient while the x-ray tube is energized.

This provision \nspecifically prohibits deliberate exposure for the following purposes: \n(1)  exposure of an individual for training, demonstration, or other non-healing arts purposes; and \n(2)  exposure of an individual for the purpose of healing arts screening except as authorized by the \n\nDepartment. \n\n(q)  X-ray patient logbook.  Each facility must maintain a written or electronic record containing the \npatient's name, the type of examinations, and the dates the examinations were performed for all \nradiographic (except dental, podiatric and veterinary exams) and fluoroscopic patient exams. The \nadministration of contrast agents as part of the patient exam must be noted in the patient logbook to \nstate that IV contrast was administered.  All adverse effects to injected contrast agents must be \nreported to the NY State Health Department, as required by law. \n\n(r)  Sealing x-ray equipment.  Sealing of x-ray units must be done only by the Department for x-ray units, \nof any type, that poses a hazard to the patient or the operator. No x-ray units sealed by the Department \nshall be put in use for clinical exams without the approval of the Department. \n\n(s)  Leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly.  The leakage radiation from the diagnostic \n\nsource assembly measured at a distance of 1 meter in any direction from the source must not exceed  \n0.88 milligray (mGy) air kerma (vice 100 milliroentgen  (mR) exposure) in 1 hour when the x-ray \ntube is operated at its leakage technique factors.  If the maximum rated peak tube potential of the tube \nhousing assembly is greater than the maximum rated peak tube potential for the diagnostic source \nassembly, positive means must be provided to limit the maximum x-ray tube potential to that of the \ndiagnostic source assembly.  \n\n(t)  Technique indicators. \n\n(1)  For x-ray equipment capable of displaying technique factors, the technique factors to be used \n\nduring an exposure must be indicated before the exposure begins.  If automatic exposure controls \nare used, the technique factors which are set prior to the exposure must be indicated.  \n\n50\n(2)  The requirement of paragraph (1) of this subdivision may be met by permanent markings on \n\nequipment having fixed technique factors.  Indication of technique factors must be visible from \nthe operator's position except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist.   \n\n(3)  The accuracy of the technique factors for the x-ray unit (e.g., indicated kilovoltage peak (kVp), \ntimer accuracy) must meet manufacturer specifications.  In the absence of a manufacturer \nspecification, the technique factor accuracy must be within ±10 percent. \n\n(u)  Beam quality. \n\n(1)  The half value layer (HVL) of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential shall not be less \nthan the values shown in Table 1 of this subdivision. If it is necessary to determine such half-\nvalue layer at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in Table 1, linear interpolation or \nextrapolation may be made.  Positive means must be provided to ensure that at least the minimum \nfiltration needed to achieve beam quality requirements is in the useful beam during each \nexposure. In the case of a system which is to be operated with more than one thickness of \nfiltration, this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector which \nwill prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in place.  In no case shall an \nx-ray unit failing to meet the minimum filtration standards in Table 1 conduct clinical patient \nexams until the x-ray unit is in compliance with Table 1. \n\nTABLE 1* \nX-Ray Tube Voltage (kilovolt peak) \n\nDesign    \nOperating \nRange \n\nMeasured \nOperating \nPotential \n\nBelow 51 \n\n51 to 70 \n\nAbove 70 \n\n30 \n40 \n50 \n51 \n60 \n70 \n71 \n80 \n90 \n100 \n110 \n120 \n130 \n140 \n150 \n\nMinimum HVL (mm in Aluminum) \n\nSpecified Dental \nSystems 1 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n2.1 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n2.7 \n3.0 \n3.2 \n3.5 \n3.8 \n4.1 \n\nOther X-Ray \nSystems (older)2 \n0.3 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n1.5 \n2.1 \n2.3 \n2.5 \n2.7 \n3.0 \n3.2 \n3.5 \n3.8 \n4.1 \n\nOther X-Ray Systems \n(newer)3 \n0.3 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n1.3 \n1.5 \n1.8 \n2.5 \n2.9 \n3.2 \n3.6 \n3.9 \n4.3 \n4.7 \n5.0 \n5.4 \n\n1  Dental x-ray systems designed for use with intraoral image receptors and manufactured after December 1, 1980. \n2  Dental x-ray systems designed for use with intraoral image receptors and manufactured before or on December \n1,1980, and all other x-ray systems subject to this section and manufactured before June 10, 2006. \n3  All x-ray systems, except dental x-ray systems designed for use with intraoral image receptors, subject to this \nsection and manufactured on or after June 10, 2006. \n* Source: 21 CFR §1020.30 (m) \n\n(2)  Measuring compliance.

Each registrant must have acceptance testing conducted on all radiographic x-\n\nray units with the exception of dental, podiatric, and bone densitometer units, prior to clinical patient \nexams being conducted with the designated x-ray units.  The acceptance testing must be conducted by \na QMP and the report must be provided to the registrant.  All non-compliance issues noted in this \nreport must be corrected prior to clinical use of the unit.  The acceptance testing report must verify the \nstated manufacturer’s tolerances for all machine testing.  If manufacturer tolerances are absent, the \nregistrant’s QMP must develop tolerances that must be used in subsequent QA testing by the \nregistrant and must be so noted in the quality assurance manual. \n\n(b)  Control and indication of technique factors. \n\n(1)  Timers.  Means must be provided to terminate the exposure at a preset time interval, a preset \n\nproduct of current and time, a preset number of pulses, or a preset radiation exposure to the image \nreceptor.  \n\n(i) \n\nExcept during serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the exposure at any \ntime during an exposure of greater than one-half second.  Except during panoramic dental \nradiography, termination of exposure must cause automatic resetting of the timer to its initial \nsetting or to zero.  It must not be possible to make an exposure when the timer is set to a zero \nor off position if either position is provided.  \n\n(ii)  During serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the x-ray exposure at any \n\ntime, but means may be provided to permit completion of any single exposure of the series in \nprocess.  \n\n(2)  Automatic exposure controls.  When an automatic exposure control is provided: \n\nindication must be made on the control panel when this mode of operation is selected; \n\n(i) \n(ii)  when the x-ray tube potential is equal to or greater than 51 kilovolts peak (kVp), the \n\n(iii) \n\nminimum exposure time for field emission equipment rated for pulse operation must be equal \nto or less than a time interval equivalent to two pulses and the minimum exposure time for all \nother equipment must be equal to or less than 1/60 second or a time interval required to \ndeliver 5 milliampere-seconds (mAs), whichever is greater;  \neither the product of peak x-ray tube potential, current, and exposure time must be limited to \nnot more than 60 kilowatt-seconds (kWs) per exposure or the product of x-ray tube current \nand exposure time must be limited to not more than 600 mAs per exposure, except when the \nx-ray tube potential is less than 51 kVp, in which case the product of x-ray tube current and \nexposure time must be limited to not more than 2,000 mAs per exposure; and \n\n52\n(iv) \n\na visible signal must indicate when an exposure has been terminated at the limits described in \nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and manual resetting must be required before further \nautomatically timed exposures can be made.  \n\n(c)  Reproducibility.   \n\n(1)  Coefficient of variation.  For any specific combination of selected technique factors, the \n\nestimated coefficient of variation of the air kerma must be no greater than 0.05.  \n\n(2)  Measuring compliance.  Determination of compliance must be based on 10 consecutive \n\nmeasurements taken within a time period of 1 hour.  Equipment manufactured after September 5, \n1978, must also have all variable controls for technique factors adjusted to alternate settings and \nreset to the test setting after each measurement.  For equipment having automatic exposure \ncontrols, compliance shall be determined with a sufficient thickness of attenuating material in the \nuseful beam such that the technique factors can be adjusted to provide individual exposures of a \nminimum of 12 pulses on field emission equipment rated for pulsed operation or no less than one-\ntenth second per exposure on all other equipment.  \n\n(3)  Alternatively,  the reproducibility of any technique value may be determined by taking  5 \n\nconsecutive measurements and utilizing the formula given below: \n\nReproducibility = (maximum measured value – minimum measured value) \nAverage of the measured five values \nThe calculated reproducibility shall be equal to ± 10percent for compliance. \n(d)  Linearity.  The following requirements apply for any fixed x-ray tube potential within the range of 40 \n\npercent to 100 percent of the maximum rated.

However, if the selection of respiratory \nprotection equipment with a protection factor greater than this multiple of peak concentration \nis inconsistent with the goal specified in 10 CFR §20.1702 of keeping the total effective dose \nequivalent ALARA, the licensee may select respiratory protection equipment with a lower \n\n104\nprotection factor provided that such a selection would result in a total effective dose \nequivalent that is ALARA. In estimating the dose to individuals from intake of airborne \nradioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when \nrespirators are worn is initially assumed to be the ambient concentration in air without \nrespiratory protection, divided by the assigned protection factor. If the dose is later found to \nbe greater than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value must be used. If the dose is \nlater found to be less than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value may be used. \n\n(4)  Requirements for possession of sealed sources. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe licensee in possession of any sealed source must follow the radiation safety and leak \ntesting requirements specified in 10 CFR §35.67. \nReports of test results for leaking or contaminated sealed sources must be made pursuant to \n10 CFR §35.3067. \n\n(iii)  A licensee authorized for medical use in possession of a licensed sealed source or \n\nbrachytherapy source must survey with a radiation survey instrument at intervals not to \nexceed 3 months all areas where such sources are stored. This shall not apply to sources in \nteletherapy units or gamma stereotactic radiosurgery units or to sealed sources in diagnostic \ndevices. \n\n(5)  Radioactive material must not be stored with either food or beverages. \n(6)  No person shall bury any licensed radioactive material within New York City. \n(7)  The provisions of 10 CFR §20.2005 do not authorize the licensed materials described to be \ndisposed of inside the City as if they were not radioactive; however, these materials may be \nshipped for disposal outside of the City as if they were not radioactive provided that the receiving \njurisdiction allows the disposal of such materials as if they were not radioactive. \n\n(8)  Vacating premises.
