The leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly measured at a distance of 1 meter in any direction from the source must not exceed\n0.88 milligray (mGy) air kerma (vice 100 milliroentgen (mR) exposure) in 1 hour when the x-ray tube is operated at its leakage technique factors. If the maximum rated peak tube potential of the tube housing assembly is greater than the maximum rated peak tube potential for the diagnostic source assembly, positive means must be provided to limit the maximum x-ray tube potential to that of the diagnostic source assembly.\nTechnique indicators.\nFor x-ray equipment capable of displaying technique factors, the technique factors to be used during an exposure must be indicated before the exposure begins. If automatic exposure controls are used, the technique factors which are set prior to the exposure must be indicated.\nThe requirement of paragraph (1) of this subdivision may be met by permanent markings on equipment having fixed technique factors. Indication of technique factors must be visible from the operator's position except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist.\nThe accuracy of the technique factors for the x-ray unit (e.g., indicated kilovoltage peak (kVp), timer accuracy) must meet manufacturer specifications. In the absence of a manufacturer specification, the technique factor accuracy must be within ±10 percent.\nBeam quality.\nThe half value layer (HVL) of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential shall not be less than the values shown in Table 1 of this subdivision. If it is necessary to determine such half-value layer at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in Table 1, linear interpolation or extrapolation may be made. Positive means must be provided to ensure that at least the minimum filtration needed to achieve beam quality requirements is in the useful beam during each exposure. In the case of a system which is to be operated with more than one thickness of filtration, this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector which will prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in place. In no case shall an x-ray unit failing to meet the minimum filtration standards in Table 1 conduct clinical patient exams until the x-ray unit is in compliance with Table 1."}

The device must be oriented to measure the highest dose to the extremity being monitored.\nThe licensee must ensure that adequate precautions are taken to prevent a deceptive exposure of an individual monitoring device, and no licensee must remove an exposure from an individual's exposure record without prior authorization from the Department. The licensee must submit the dosimeter for processing with due diligence and in no event in excess of the time period specified by the manufacturer of the dosimeter.\nRespiratory protection.\nIf the licensee uses respiratory protection equipment to limit intakes pursuant to 10 CFR\n§§20.1701 through 20.1705, the licensee must issue a written policy statement on respirator usage covering:\nthe routine, non-routine, and emergency use of respirators; and\nlimitations on periods of respirator use and relief from respirator use; and\nthe use of process or other engineering controls, instead of respirators.\nFor a licensee to make allowance for respiratory equipment when estimating the exposure of individuals to airborne radioactive material, the following additional condition applies: the licensee selects respiratory protection equipment that provides a protection factor, specified in 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix A, greater than the multiple by which peak concentrations of airborne radioactive materials in the working area are expected to exceed the values specified in Table 1, Column 3 of 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix A. However, if the selection of respiratory protection equipment with a protection factor greater than this multiple of peak concentration is inconsistent with the goal specified in 10 CFR §20.1702 of keeping the total effective dose equivalent ALARA, the licensee may select respiratory protection equipment with a lower\nprotection factor provided that such a selection would result in a total effective dose equivalent that is ALARA. In estimating the dose to individuals from intake of airborne radioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when respirators are worn is initially assumed to be the ambient concentration in air without respiratory protection, divided by the assigned protection factor. If the dose is later found to be greater than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value must be used. If the dose is later found to be less than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value may be used.\nRequirements for possession of sealed sources.\nThe licensee in possession of any sealed source must follow the radiation safety and leak testing requirements specified in 10 CFR §35.67.\nReports of test results for leaking or contaminated sealed sources must be made pursuant to 10 CFR §35.3067.\nA licensee authorized for medical use in possession of a licensed sealed source or brachytherapy source must survey with a radiation survey instrument at intervals not to exceed 3 months all areas where such sources are stored. This shall not apply to sources in teletherapy units or gamma stereotactic radiosurgery units or to sealed sources in diagnostic devices.\nRadioactive material must not be stored with either food or beverages.\nNo person shall bury any licensed radioactive material within New York City.\nThe provisions of 10 CFR §20.2005 do not authorize the licensed materials described to be disposed of inside the City as if they were not radioactive; however, these materials may be shipped for disposal outside of the City as if they were not radioactive provided that the receiving jurisdiction allows the disposal of such materials as if they were not radioactive.\nVacating premises. Each specific licensee must notify the Department in writing of intent to vacate not less than 30 days before vacating or relinquishing possession or control of premises which may have been contaminated with radioactive material as a result of licensed activities. When deemed necessary by the Department, the licensee must decontaminate the premises to such levels as the Department may specify.\nRecordkeeping requirements for receipt, use, and disposition of radioactive material.\nEach licensee must maintain records of the receipt, use, and disposition of radioactive material in units of becquerels or microcuries and must include from whom such materials were received and the ultimate disposition.\nThe licensee must retain these records for 3 years after the record is made.\nThe Department may order the removal, through an authorized person, or the surrender to the Department, of any radiation source by any person who:\ndoes not hold, or continue to hold, a valid license issued by the Department; or\nis not able or equipped, or who fails to observe with regard to such radiation source, those radiation protection standards established or enforced by the Department or who uses such radiation source in violation of law, regulation, this Article, order or license issued by the Department. Such person must decontaminate any premises which may have been contaminated with radioactive material as a result of any such activities to such radiation levels as the Department may specify. The expenses incidental to such transfer, surrender, and decontamination must be borne by such person responsible for the source.\nIn determining the extent of any individual's exposure to radiation subsequent to any radiation accident, contamination, theft or loss, the licensee must comply with all orders of the\nDepartment directing such licensee to make available to such individual appropriate medical evaluation services or appropriate tests and to furnish a copy of the reports of such evaluation or test to the Department.\nA licensee or applicant for a license must obtain any permits required by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to 6 NYCRR Part 380, or any successor law\nor regulation, and must develop, document, and implement a discharge minimization program required by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to 6 NYCRR §380-7, or any successor law or regulation."}
