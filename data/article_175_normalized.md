The scattering media for CTDI consist of two (16 and 32 cm in diameter) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, e.g., acrylic or Lucite) cylinders of 14 cm length. The equation is:

where:D(z) = the radiation dose profile along the z-axis,

N = the number of tomographic sections imaged in a single axial scan. This is equal to the number of data channels used in a particular scan. The value of N may be less than or equal to the maximum number of data channels available on the system, and

T = the width of the tomographic section along the z-axis imaged by one data channel. In multiple-detector-row (multi-slice) CT scanners, several detector elements may be grouped together to form one data channel. In single-detector-row (single-slice) CT, the z-axis collimation (T) is the nominal scan width.

"CT number" means the number used to represent the x-ray attenuation associated with each elemental area of the CT image:

CT Number = k (μx - μw)/μw

where:

k = constant, a normal value of 1,000 when the Houndsfield scale of CT number is used;

μx = Linear attenuation coefficient of the material of interest;

μw = Linear attenuation coefficient of water.

"CTDI100" means the accumulated multiple scan dose at the center of a 100-mm scan and underestimates the accumulated dose for longer scan lengths. It is thus smaller than the equilibrium dose. The CTDI100 requires integration of the radiation dose profile from a single axial scan over specific integration limits. In the case of CTDI100, the integration limits are +50 mm, which corresponds to the 100-mm length of the commercially available "pencil" ionization chamber. CTDI100 is acquired using a 100-mm long, 3-cc active volume CT "pencil" ionization chamber and one of the two standard CTDI acrylic phantoms (16 and 32 cm diameter) and a stationary patient table. The equation is:

CTDI100 = 1/NT ∫D(z)dz ; spanned +50mm to -50mm

## §175.11Communications with workers.

Purpose and scope. This section establishes requirements for notices, instructions and reports by registrants to individuals engaged in activities under a registration. This section also sets forth options available to such individuals in connection with Department inspections of registrants conducted to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Article and all applicable regulations and conditions stated on the registration regarding radiological working conditions. The regulations in this section apply to all persons who receive, possess, produce, use, own or transfer sources of radiation registered with the Department or are otherwise subject to this Article.

Posting of notices to workers.

Each registrant must post current copies of the following documents:

# Article 175 of this Article, or a notice providing an electronic link or internet address to a copy of Article 175 of this Article;

the registration or certified registration and the conditions or documents incorporated by reference into the certified registration and any amendments thereto;

the operating procedures applicable to the work under the registration or certified registration;

any notice of violation involving radiological working conditions, any proposed imposition of civil penalty or order issued pursuant to this Article and any response from the registrant.

If posting of a document specified in this section is not practicable, the registrant may post a notice which describes the document and states where it may be examined.

A current copy of the "Notice to Employees" prescribed by the Department must be posted by each registrant wherever individuals work in or frequent any portion of a restricted area.

Documents, notices, or forms posted pursuant to this Article must appear conspicuously in a sufficient number of places to permit individuals engaged in work under the certified registration or registration to observe them on the way to or from any particular work location to which the document applies, and must be replaced if defaced or altered.

Department documents posted pursuant to this section must be posted within 2 working days after receipt of the documents from the Department; the registrant's response, if any, must be posted within 2 working days after dispatch from the registrant. Such documents must remain posted for a minimum of 5 working days or until action correcting the violation has been completed, whichever is later.

Instructions to workers.

All individuals working in or frequenting any portion of a restricted area must be:

kept informed of the storage, transfer, or use of radiation producing equipment or of radiation in such portions of the restricted area;

instructed in the operating procedures applicable to work under the registration or certified registration, in the health protection problems associated with exposure to such radiation, in precautions or procedures to minimize exposure, and in the purposes and functions of protective devices employed, and must be required to demonstrate familiarity with such precautions, procedures and devices;

instructed in, and instructed to observe, to the extent within the worker's control, the applicable provisions of this Article, registrations or certified registrations for the protection of personnel from exposures to radiation occurring in such areas;

instructed of their responsibility to report promptly to the registrant on any condition which may lead to or cause a violation of this Article or the registration, or unnecessary exposure to radiation;

instructed in the appropriate response to warnings made in the event of any unusual occurrence or malfunction that may involve exposure to radiation; and

advised as to the radiation exposure reports which workers must be given or may request pursuant to this section.

Instruction must be given before an individual begins work in a restricted area and at least annually thereafter.

Records documenting individual worker instruction must be maintained for inspection by the Department for 5 years.

# Each registrant must inform each worker who is monitored pursuant to §175.17 of the worker's exposure to radiation or radioactive material as shown in records maintained by the registrant pursuant to

# §175.22. The information must be provided at least annually.

# Each registrant must make dose information available to workers as shown in records maintained by the registrant under the provisions of §175.24.

The individual engaged or formerly engaged in activities controlled by the registrant may request his or her annual dose report.

The report must include the dose record for each year the worker was required to be monitored pursuant to this Article. Such report must be furnished to the individual within 30 days from the date of the request, or within 30 days after the dose of the individual has been determined by the registrant, whichever is later.

At the request of a worker who is terminating employment with the registrant in work involving exposure to radiation during the current year, each registrant must provide at termination to each such worker, or to the worker's designee, a written report regarding the radiation dose received by that worker from operations of the registrant during the current year or fraction thereof.

Presence of representatives of registrants and workers during inspections.

Each registrant must afford the Department at all reasonable times an opportunity to perform an inspection of machines, activities, facilities, premises and records required pursuant to this Article.

During an inspection, Department inspectors may consult privately with workers. The registrant, or that person's representative, may accompany the Department inspectors during other phases of an inspection.

If, at the time of inspection, an individual has been authorized by the workers to represent them during Department inspections, the registrant must notify the inspectors of such authorization and must give the workers' representatives an opportunity to accompany the inspectors during the inspection of physical working conditions.

Each worker’s representative must be routinely engaged in work under control of the registrant and must have received instructions as specified in this section.

Different representatives of registrants and workers may accompany the inspectors during different phases of an inspection if there is no resulting interference with the conduct of the inspection. However, only one workers' representative at a time may accompany the inspectors.

With the approval of the registrant and the workers' representative, an individual who is not routinely engaged in work under control of the registrant, for example a consultant to the registrant or to the workers' representative, must be afforded the opportunity to accompany inspectors during the inspection of physical working conditions.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, Department inspectors are authorized to refuse to permit accompaniment by any individual who deliberately interferes with a fair and orderly inspection. With regard to any area containing proprietary information, the workers' representative for that area must be an individual previously authorized by the licensee or registrant to enter that area.

Consultation with workers during inspections.

Department inspectors may consult privately with workers concerning matters of occupational radiation protection and other matters related to applicable provisions of this Article, certified registrations and registrations to the extent the inspectors deem necessary for the conduct of an effective and thorough inspection.

During the course of an inspection any worker may bring privately to the attention of the inspectors, either orally or in writing, any past or present condition which the worker has reason to believe may have contributed to or caused any violations of this Article, certified registration condition or registration, or any unnecessary exposure of any individual to radiation from sources of radiation under the registrant's control.

Requests by workers for inspections.

Any worker or representative of workers who believes that a violation of this Article, registration, certified registration or license conditions exists or has occurred in work under a license or certificate of registration with regard to radiological working conditions in which the worker is engaged, may request an inspection by giving notice of the alleged violation to the Department. Any such notice must be in writing, must set forth the specific grounds for the notice, and must be signed by the worker or representative of the workers. A copy must be provided to the licensee or registrant by the Department no later than at the time of inspection. The worker giving such notice may request that his or her name and the name of individuals referred to therein not appear in such copy or any record published, released, or made available by the Department, except for good cause shown.

If, upon receipt of such notice, the Department determines that the complaint meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged violation exists or has occurred, an inspection shall be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such alleged violation exists or has occurred. Inspections performed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision need not be limited to matters referred to in the complaint.

No licensee, registrant, or contractor or subcontractor of a registrant shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any worker because such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under this Article or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such worker on behalf of such worker or others of any option afforded by this Article.

Inspections not warranted; informal review.

If the Department determines, with respect to a complaint under paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this section that an inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation exists or has occurred, the Department shall notify the complainant in writing of such determination. The complainant may obtain review of such determination by submitting a written statement of position with the Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Health Services, who will provide the licensee or registrant with a copy of such statement by certified mail, excluding, at the request of the complainant, the name of the complainant. The registrant may submit an opposing written statement of position with the Deputy Commissioner of Environmental Health Services who will provide the complainant with a copy of such statement by certified mail.

Upon the request of the complainant, the Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Health Services may hold an informal conference in which the complainant and the licensee or registrant may orally present their views. An informal conference may also be held at the request of the licensee or registrant, but disclosure of the identity of the complainant will be made only following receipt of written authorization from the complainant. After considering all written or oral views presented, the Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Health Services shall affirm, modify, or reverse the determination of the Department’s Office of Radiological Health and

furnish the complainant and the licensee or registrant a written notification of the decision and the reason therefor.

If the Department determines that an inspection is not warranted because the requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this section have not been met, the complainant shall be notified in writing of such determination. Such determination shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new complaint meeting the requirements of such paragraph.

## §175.12 Quality Assurance (QA) program requirements for diagnostic facilities.

Purpose and scope.

## This section establishes quality assurance (as defined in §175.08) requirements for the use of machine-produced radiation or the radiation therefrom for diagnostic uses in the healing arts. The requirements in this section are intended to provide for the protection of the public health and safety and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, other applicable requirements in this Article.

Diagnostic facilities.

Except dental, podiatric or veterinary facilities, each radiation installation performing diagnostic x-rays on humans must implement a quality assurance program that includes at a minimum:

the adoption of a facility- and equipment-specific QA manual containing written policies and procedures for radiation protection and describing the facility's quality assurance program. Policies and procedures must be consistent with the types of equipment and services provided including, but not limited to, identification of patients, use of gonadal or scoliosis shielding, personnel monitoring, protection of pregnant workers and patients and holding of patients. The quality assurance manual must describe the various processing, generator and systems QA tests appropriate for the types of equipment and services provided in sufficient detail to ensure that they will be performed properly;

the performance of QA tests and correction of deficiencies as specified in the QA manual;

the maintenance of equipment records for each diagnostic imaging system, containing test results, records of equipment repairs and other pertinent information;

requirements for performing appropriate testing as determined by the QMP after replacement or repair of equipment components that could adversely affect the resolution of the x-ray system and/or could cause an increase in patient dose;

the provisions of a formalized in-service training program for employees including, but not limited to, quality assurance and radiation safety procedures;

the direct or indirect determination of radiation output at the point of skin entry for examinations routinely performed at the facility;

the provision of the information described in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph to any patient upon request; and

the performance of and analysis of repeated, rejected or diagnostic events which are designed to identify and correct problems and to optimize quality.

Each registrant must maintain written records documenting QA and audit activities for review by the Department. Such records must be maintained by the registrant at least until after the next scheduled inspection is completed by the Department.

Diagnostic facility registrants required to maintain the facility-specific QA manual must comply with the requirements of this Article, as well as any registration conditions or Department directives or orders. Failure to maintain an up-to-date QA manual, or not adhering to this Article or Department directives or orders, shall be deemed as equivalent to the registrant not conducting a mandated QA program in violation of this section.

For hospital registrants only, a QMP, or the Radiation Safety Officer working with a QMP, must conduct oversight of its quality assurance programs, by:

auditing the QA program on an annual basis for compliance with the hospital’s QA manual and the requirements of this Article; and

submitting the annual audit report to the hospital radiation safety committee. The annual audit report must document the review of the following:

the hospital’s personnel monitoring program for compliance with this Article and hospital QA manual requirements; and

the hospital’s equipment QA testing, including frequency of testing, and resolution of equipment failures as to timely repair and testing, if any; and

the calibration of radiation instruments used for equipment testing, if owned by the hospital; and

the status of hospital employee training, both annual training requirements and Article requirements, for training hospital staff for specific equipment types; and

review of all medical events that occurred in the hospital in relation to x-ray exams and an evaluation of the measures to prevent such re-occurrences and their effectiveness.

The recommendations cited in the annual hospital audit report of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (4) of this subdivision must be reviewed by the hospital radiation safety committee for a compliance determination. A written record of the hospital radiation safety committee decisions on the annual audit recommendations must be retained for review by the Department during periodic inspections.

Neonatal imaging. Neonatal intensive care units must develop a QA program which includes the following protocols:

establishing a technique chart for neonatal imaging including, at a minimum, specific techniques for chest and abdomen, along with corresponding direct or indirect determination of entrance skin dose; and

an annual training program for Licensed Radiographic Technologists (LRTs) for conducting neonatal imaging; and

a protocol for the proper use of neonatal collimation; and

a protocol of gonadal shielding; and

each facility must conduct an annual report on the compliance with the facility’s neonatal QA program and forward such report to the facility radiation safety committee for review

Each registrant that conducts x-ray imaging of children must establish specific techniques at least for 1-year old, 5-year old and 10-year old children, specific to PA chest and abdomen x-ray studies. Additionally, the entrance skin exposure must be directly or indirectly determined for the latter studies and posted in the facility along with the technique chart wherever it is reasonable to expect that children of such an age group can be x-rayed.

X-ray film processing facilities. Registrants using analog image receptors (e.g., radiographic film) must have available suitable equipment for the handling and processing of radiographic film in accordance with the following provisions:

Manually developed film shall be prohibited, except during dental surgical procedures when required.

Automatic processors and other closed processing systems:

automatic processors must be operated and maintained following manufacturer specifications.

films must be developed in accordance with the time-temperature relationships recommended by the film manufacturer; in the absence of such recommendations, the film must be developed using the following chart:

| Developer Temperature | Minimum Immersion Time* |   |

| 31 | 88 | 27 |
| 30.5 | 87 | 28 |
| 30 | 86 | 29 |
| 29.5 | 85 | 30 |
| *Immersion time only, no crossover time included. |  |  |

Processing deviations from the above requirements of this section must be documented by the registrant in such manner that the requirements are shown to be met or exceeded (e.g., extended processing and special rapid chemistry).

Additional requirements for facilities using x-ray film.

Pass boxes, if provided, must be constructed to exclude light from the darkroom when cassettes are placed in or removed from the boxes and must incorporate adequate shielding from stray radiation to prevent exposure of undeveloped film.

Darkrooms typically used by more than one individual must prevent accidental entry while undeveloped films are being handled or processed.

Film must be stored in a cool, dry place and must be protected from exposure to stray radiation. Film in open packages must be stored in a light-tight container.

Film cassettes and intensifying screens must be inspected periodically and must be cleaned and replaced as necessary.

Outdated x-ray film past the manufacturer’s expiration date must not be used for diagnostic radiographs of patients.

The film and intensifying screen must be spectrally compatible.

Facilities must maintain a light-tight darkroom, use proper safelighting and safeguards, and evaluate darkroom integrity and daylight loading systems for film fog every 6 months and after a change that may impact film fog.

X-ray film processing facilities other than dental, podiatry or veterinary must:

have a continuous and documented sensitometric QA program, including QA tests for speed, contrast and fog. These tests must be performed according to specifications of the manufacturer, a QMP, or a nationally-recognized organization.

maintain a light-tight darkroom and use proper safelighting and safeguards such that any film type in use exposed in a cassette to x-radiation sufficient to produce an optical density from 1 to 2 when processed shall not increase in optical density by more than 0.1 when exposed in the darkroom for 2 minutes with all safelights on. If used, daylight film handling boxes must preclude fogging of the film.

limit the base plus fog of unexposed film to an optical density less than 0.25 when developed by the routine procedure used by the facility.

Facilities using Computed Radiography (CR) or Direct Digital Radiography (DDR).

Commencing July 1, 2021, when exposure indicators are available, the facility must establish and document an acceptable range for the exposure values for examinations routinely performed at

the facility. The indicated exposure values for a representative percentage of images taken must

be compared to the established range. Consistent deviations from established ranges must be investigated, corrective actions taken as necessary, and results documented. This exposure range

developed above must be posted at or near the x-ray console.

Facilities must establish and follow an image QA program in accord with the recommendations of a QMP, the system manufacturer, or a nationally recognized organization

Facilities other than dental, podiatric and veterinary, must quarterly complete phantom image evaluation using a phantom approved by a QMP or manufacturer. The analysis at a minimum must include: artifacts, spatial resolution, contrast/noise and exposure indicator constancy.

In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision, CR facilities must establish a schedule of CR cassette erasure consistent with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Requirements for permitted radiographic facilities’ Primary Diagnostic Monitors (PDM).

The requirements of this subdivision do not apply to dental, podiatric, veterinary, bone densitometer, nuclear medicine imaging and mammography facilities.

The following definitions apply to this subdivision:

"Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)" means a standard for handling, storing, printing and transmitting information in medical imaging.

"Documenting" means written, electronic or photographic records of testing performance. "Maximum luminance" means the maximum light emission from the PDM front surface as measured by a calibrated photometer in units of candela/m2.

"Medical monitor" means any monitor that has both a built-in photometer and a QA software program allowing for routine QA tests to be performed.

"Monitor" means a display device that shows the results of a patient radiological image. "Off-site PDM" means when the registrant contracts with a tele-radiology service for patient

diagnosis of x-ray procedures. In such circumstances, the tele-radiology service must establish a PDM QA program that conforms to Department requirements.

"Primary Diagnostic Monitor (PDM)" means a monitor used to render a final diagnosis of a patient exam, including interpretations of patient mammograms. Monitors attached to digital units used as PDMs must have a QA program that complies with Department requirements, with the exception of monitors attached to bone densitometer units.

"Preliminary reads ("wet reads")" means a type of monitor that is exempt from PDM requirements. For purposes of this section, monitors used for wet reads, such as a monitor in a hospital emergency room used to make decisions about trauma patients and monitors of fluoroscopy units, are not considered PDMs.

"Registrant" means, for the purposes of the PDM QA requirements of this subdivision, the individual responsible for ensuring that a PDM QA program is implemented on site. This requirement still

applies if the registrant contracts with an off-site service, for example, tele-radiology service, for patient final diagnostic evaluations.

"Test pattern" means, for the purposes of PDM QA requirements, a pattern that is either a Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) test pattern, or the American Association of Medical Physicists (AAPM) Task Group (TG) #18 test pattern (TG 18 test pattern) or a test pattern from an applicable successor national standard.

QA tests mandated for a PDM QA program. Each facility must make or have made QA tests to monitor equipment performance and maintain records of data collected. The facility must document their PDM quality assurance program in the facility’s QA manual along with the results of the QA tests required. The QA tests required to be performed must include, at a minimum:

Visual test pattern evaluation (TG-18QC, SMPTE, or equivalent).

DICOM calibration of the Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF) for each medical monitor on site at the registrant’s location.

Maximum luminance output.

Minimum luminance output.

Luminance ratio of maximum to minimum.

Evaluation of viewing conditions.

## §175.13Occupational dose limits.

The registrant must control the occupational dose to individual adults to the following dose limits:

an annual limit, which is the more limiting of:

the total effective dose equivalent being equal to 0.05 sievert (5 rem); or

the sum of the deep dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye being equal to 0.5 sievert (50 rem).

the annual limits to the lens of the eye, to the skin, and to the extremities which are:

a lens dose equivalent of 0.15 sievert (15 rem); and

a shallow dose equivalent of 0.5 sievert (50 rem) to the skin or to any extremity.

When the external exposure is determined by measurement with an external personal monitoring device, the deep-dose equivalent must be used in place of the effective dose equivalent, unless the effective dose equivalent is determined by a dosimetry method approved by the Department. The assigned deep dose equivalent shall be for the portion of the body receiving the highest exposure. The assigned shallow dose equivalent must be the dose averaged over the contiguous 10 square centimeters of skin receiving the highest exposure:

## when a protective apron is worn while working with medical fluoroscopic equipment and monitoring is conducted as specified in §175.17(b)(4), the effective dose equivalent for external radiation shall be determined as follows: when only one individual monitoring device is used and it is located at the neck (collar) outside the protective apron, the reported deep dose equivalent value divided by 5.6 shall be the effective dose equivalent for external radiation; or

when individual monitoring devices are worn, both under the protective apron at the waist and outside the protective apron at the neck, the effective dose equivalent for external radiation shall be assigned the value of the sum of the deep dose equivalent reported for the individual monitoring device located at the waist under the protective apron multiplied by 1.5 and the deep dose equivalent reported for the individual monitoring device located at the neck outside the protective apron multiplied by 0.04.

The registrant must reduce the dose that an individual may be allowed to receive in the current year by the occupational dose amount received while employed elsewhere during the current year.

The annual occupational dose limits for minors are 10 percent of the annual occupational dose limits for adult workers specified in this section.

Dose to an embryo/fetus.

The registrant must ensure that the dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant worker, does not exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem).

The registrant must review exposure history and adjust working conditions so as to avoid a monthly exposure of more than 0.5 mSv (50 mrem) to a declared pregnant worker.

The dose to an embryo/fetus shall be the sum of:

the deep dose equivalent to the declared pregnant worker; and

the dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus resulting from radionuclides in the embryo/fetus and radionuclides in the declared pregnant worker.

If, by the time the worker declares pregnancy to the registrant, the dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus is found to have exceeded 5 mSv (0.5 rem), or is within 0.5 mSv (50 mrem) of this dose, the registrant shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subdivision if the additional dose to the embryo/fetus does not exceed 0.5 mSv (50 mrem) during the remainder of the pregnancy.

## §175.14Dose limits for individual members of the public.

Each registrant must conduct operations so that:

the total effective dose equivalent to individual members of the public from the registered operation, does not exceed 1 millisievert (0.1 rem) in a year, exclusive of the dose contribution from background radiation, from any medical administration the individual has received, from exposure to individuals administered radioactive material and released in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 35, or from voluntary participation in medical research programs.

the dose in any unrestricted area from external sources does not exceed 0.02 millisievert (2 mrem) in any one hour.

If the registrant permits members of the public to have access to restricted areas, the limits for members of the public continue to apply to those individuals.

The Department may impose additional restrictions on radiation levels in unrestricted areas by registration condition.

## §175.15Compliance with dose limits for individual members of the public.

The registrant must conduct surveys of radiation levels in unrestricted areas.

## The registrant must show compliance with the annual dose limit in §175.14 by demonstrating by measurement or calculation that the total effective dose equivalent to the individual likely to receive the highest dose from the registered operation does not exceed the annual dose limit.

## §175.16Surveys and monitoring.

Each registrant must conduct surveys to comply with this Article to evaluate the magnitude and extent of radiation levels and potential radiological hazards.

The registrant must ensure that instruments and equipment used for quantitative radiation measurements, for radiation survey purposes, are calibrated at intervals not to exceed 12 months for the radiation measured, except when a more frequent interval is specified in this Article.

All personnel dosimeters, except for direct and indirect reading pocket ionization chambers and those dosimeters used to measure the dose to any extremity, that require processing to determine the radiation dose, must be processed and evaluated by a dosimetry processor:

holding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and

approved in this accreditation process for the type of radiation or radiations included in the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program that most closely approximates the type of radiation or radiations for which the individual wearing the dosimeter is monitored.

The registrant must ensure that adequate precautions are taken to prevent a deceptive exposure of an individual monitoring device.

No registrant shall remove an exposure from an individual's exposure record without prior authorization from the Department. To remove an exposure from an individual's exposure record, the registrant must provide the following documentation to the Department:

a letter to the Department indicating the person whose exposure is to be removed along with an investigation into the possible causes for the exposure and a signed note from the individual concurring with the removal of the exposure; and

a copy of the individual’s personnel monitoring report along with the investigation the personnel monitor vendor conducted of the exposure. For occurrences where the personnel monitor vendor indicates that a static exposure occurred on the personnel monitoring report sent to the registrant, the latter investigation is waived.

## §175.17Conditions requiring individual monitoring of external occupational dose.

Each registrant must monitor exposures from sources of radiation to demonstrate compliance with the occupational dose limits of this Article.

Each registrant must supply and require the use of individual monitoring devices by:

## adults likely to receive, in 1 year from sources external to the body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of the limits in §175.13; and

## minors and declared pregnant workers likely to receive, in 1 year from sources external to the body, a deep dose equivalent in excess of 10 percent of any of the applicable limits in §175.13; and

declared pregnant workers likely to receive during the entire pregnancy, from radiation sources external to the body, a deep dose equivalent in excess of 1 millisievert (0.1 rem); and

all individuals working with medical fluoroscopic equipment, including equipment operators and other staff physically present at the treatment location who are not behind protective shielding.

All personnel monitoring devices used to monitor fluoroscopic radiation exposures must be returned to the vendor for processing on a monthly basis, except that for individuals only working with mini-C arm fluoroscopy equipment, the monitoring devices must be returned at least quarterly.

The registrant must submit the dosimeter for processing with due diligence and never after the time specified by the manufacturer of the dosimeter. Where dosimeters are processed on the registrant’s premises, the registrant must require monitored individuals to read their monitors monthly.

## §175.18Location of individual monitoring devices.

## Each registrant must ensure that individuals who are required to monitor occupational doses in accordance with §175.13 use individual monitoring devices as follows:

an individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the whole body must be worn at the unshielded location of the whole body likely to receive the highest exposure. For individuals wearing a protective apron, when only 1 individual monitoring device is used, it must be located at the neck (collar) outside the protective apron. When a second individual monitoring device is used for the same purpose, it must be located under the protective apron at the waist. The second individual monitoring device is required for a declared pregnant worker.

## an individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to an embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant worker, pursuant to §175.17, must be located at the waist under any protective apron being worn by the worker;

## an individual monitoring device used for monitoring the lens dose equivalent, to demonstrate compliance with §175.13, must be located at the neck (collar), outside any protective apron being worn by the monitored individual, or at an unshielded location closer to the eye;

## an individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the extremities, to demonstrate compliance with §175.13, must be worn on the extremity likely to receive the highest exposure. Each

individual monitoring device must be oriented to measure the highest dose to the extremity being monitored.

## §175.19Labeling radiation machines.

Each registrant must ensure that each radiation machine is labeled in a conspicuous manner which cautions individuals that radiation is produced when it is energized.

## §175.20Records of radiation protection programs.

Each registrant must maintain records of the radiation protection program, including audits, records of surveys, calibrations, maintenance and modifications (e.g., major software and hardware upgrades) performed on the x-ray system and a copy of all correspondence with the Department regarding the x-ray system.

Unless otherwise indicated, the registrant must retain the records required by subdivision (a) of this section for a minimum of 5 years after the record is made, except that model and serial numbers of all major components and user's manuals for those components, including software, must be maintained for the life of the system.

## §175.21Determination and records of prior occupational dose.

## For each individual who is likely to receive, within 1 year, an occupational dose requiring monitoring pursuant to §175.17, the registrant must:

determine the occupational radiation dose received during the current year; and

request in writing the records of cumulative occupational radiation dose.

In complying with the requirements of this section, a registrant may:

accept, as a record of the occupational dose that the individual received during the current year, a written signed statement from the individual, or from the individual's most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, that discloses the nature and the amount of any occupational dose that the individual received during the current year; and

accept, as the record of cumulative radiation dose, an up-to-date Department form or equivalent, signed by the individual and countersigned by an appropriate official of the most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, or the individual's current employer, if the individual is not employed by the registrant; and

obtain reports of the individual's dose equivalent from the most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, or the individual's current employer, if the individual is not employed by the registrant, by telephone, telegram, facsimile, other electronic media or letter. The registrant must request a written verification of the dose data if the authenticity of the transmitted report cannot be established.

The registrant must record the exposure history, with all the following required information:

the form or record must show each period in which the individual received occupational exposure to radiation or radioactive material and must be signed by the individual who received the exposure. For each period for which the registrant obtains reports, the registrant must use the dose shown in the report. For any period in which the registrant does not obtain a report, the registrant must place a notation in the record or equivalent indicating the periods of time for which data are not available.

for the purposes of complying with this requirement, registrants are not required to partition historical dose between external dose equivalent and internal committed dose equivalent. Occupational exposure histories that do not include effective dose equivalent may be used in the absence of specific information on the intake of radionuclides by the individual.

If the registrant is unable to obtain a complete record of an individual's current and previously accumulated occupational dose, the registrant shall assume:

in establishing administrative controls for the current year, that the allowable dose limit for the individual is reduced by 12.5 millisievert (1.25 rem) for each quarter for which records were

unavailable and the individual was engaged in activities that could have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and

that the individual is not available for planned special exposures.

The registrant must retain the records required by this section until the Department terminates each pertinent registration requiring this record. This includes records required under the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994.

Upon termination of the registration, the registrant must permanently store such records, or must make provision with the Department for transfer of such records to the Department.

## §175.22Records of individual monitoring results.

Recordkeeping. Each registrant must maintain records of doses received by all individuals for whom monitoring is required by this Article. These records must include, when applicable, the deep dose equivalent to the whole body, lens dose equivalent, shallow dose equivalent to the skin, and shallow dose equivalent to the extremities.

The registrant must make entries of the records of individual monitoring results at intervals not to exceed 1 year.

The registrant must maintain individual monitoring results in clear and legible records containing all required information by the Department.

The registrant must maintain the records of dose to an embryo/fetus with the records of dose to the declared pregnant worker. The declaration of pregnancy, including the estimated date of conception, must also be kept on file, but may be maintained separately from the dose records.

The registrant must retain each required form or record until the Department terminates the certified registration or registration requiring the record.

## §175.23Records of dose to individual members of the public.

Each registrant must maintain records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the dose limit for individual members of the public.

The registrant must retain the records of dose to individual members of the public until the Department terminates each pertinent registration or certified registration requiring the record.

## §175.24Form of records.

Each record required by this Article must be legible throughout the specified retention period and, where required, must be on the appropriate Department form. The record must be the original or a reproduced copy or a microform, provided that the copy or microform is authenticated by authorized personnel and that the microform is capable of producing a clear copy throughout the required retention period, or the record may also be stored in electronic media with the capability for producing legible, accurate and complete records during the required retention period. Records, such as letters, drawings, and specifications, must include all pertinent information, such as stamps, initials and signatures.

The registrant must maintain adequate safeguards against tampering with and loss of records.

The discontinuance or expiration of authorized activities does not relieve any person who possesses any radiation source of responsibility for retaining all records required by this Article.

## §175.25Notification and reporting of events.

Immediate notification. Notwithstanding other requirements for notification in this Article, each registrant must immediately report each unintended event involving a source of radiation possessed by the registrant that may have caused or threatens to cause any of the following conditions for an individual to receive:

a total effective dose equivalent of 0.25 sievert (25 rem) or more; or

a lens dose equivalent of 0.75 sievert (75 rem) or more; or

a shallow dose equivalent to the skin or extremities or a total organ dose equivalent of 2.5 sievert (250 rem) or more.

Twenty-four hour notification. Each registrant must, within 24 hours of discovery, report to the Department:

Any unintended event involving a registered source of radiation possessed by the registrant that may have caused, or threatens to cause, any of the following conditions for an individual to receive in a period of 24 hours:

This policy, at a minimum, must describe the training of Licensed Radiologic Technologists (LRTs) on the proper care and usage of protective garments; how storage sites for lead protective garments will be evaluated and maintained; and include procedures for how LRTs report lead protective garment problems to the radiation safety officer.

All protective garments must be checked annually for defects such as holes (not including pinholes that do not affect the performance of the protective garment), cracks, and tears by using one or more of the following methods: visual investigation, tactile investigation, or x-ray imaging. Protective garments that are used by operators conducting fluoroscopic procedures must be checked using all three methods listed. If a defect is found, the lead protective garment must be removed from service and either replaced or repaired as needed to conform to the manufacturers’ specifications.

Radiation exposure control.

Exposure initiation. Means must be provided to initiate the radiation exposure by a deliberate action on the part of the operator, such as the depression of a switch. Radiation exposure must not be initiated without such an action. In addition, it must not be possible to initiate an exposure when the timer is set to a "zero" or "off" position if either position is provided.

Exposure indication. Means must be provided for visual indication observable at or from the operator's protected position whenever x-rays are produced. In addition, an audible signal to the operator must indicate that the exposure has terminated.

Operator and ancillary personnel protection for veterinary systems. All stationary, mobile or portable x-ray systems used for veterinary work must be provided with either a 2 meter (6.5 feet) high protective barrier for operator protection during exposures, or must allow the operator to be at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the tube housing assembly during exposures. Otherwise, in cases where animals are held, the operator and ancillary personnel must be protected by a minimum of 0.25 mm lead equivalent from scatter radiation and 0.5 mm from the useful beam.

## §175.47General requirements for all radiation equipment.

## All x-ray equipment must be installed and operated in accordance with the equipment manufacturer’s specifications. If the registrant is required to have a QA program pursuant to §175.12(b)(1), and if the manufacturer’s specifications are not available, the registrant’s QMP or RSO must establish specifications for equipment use and document the specifications in the registrant’s QA Manual. If the Department finds that the specifications present unacceptable tolerances, the Department shall require the registrant to utilize new specifications and shall notify the registrant of such in writing.

All functional x-ray units registered by the Department shall be subject to inspection by Department staff, or by individuals directed by the Department to inspect such units, such as CRESOs.

Radiation safety requirements. The registrant shall be responsible for directing the operation of the x-ray system under their administrative control and must assure that the requirements of this Article are met in the operation of the x-ray system.

A current copy of NYC Health Code Article 175 must be maintained and readily accessible by the registrant either in hard copy or electronic format.

## Registrants required to have a QA program pursuant to §175.12(b)(1) must have a written radiation safety program as part of their QA program. The radiation safety program must include, but not be limited to, the following:

that the use of ionizing radiation within its purview is performed in accordance with existing laws and regulations.

that all persons are protected as required by this Article.

## that upon discovery of a medical event (as defined in this Article), the registrant must follow the applicable requirements of §175.25 concerning notification to the Department.

If an x-ray system does not meet the provisions of this Article, then the registrant must correct such non-compliance, or initiate necessary corrective action, within 30 days of such discovery.

Individuals operating the x-ray systems must meet all licensure, training and experience qualifications required by the Department.

A sufficient number of protective apparel (e.g., aprons, gloves, collars) and shields must be available to provide the necessary radiation protection for all patients and personnel who are involved with x-ray operations.

The registrant must use auxiliary equipment designed to minimize patient and personnel exposure commensurate with the needed diagnostic information.

Neither the x-ray tube housing nor the collimating device shall be held during an exposure. Exceptions may be allowed for Department-approved devices specifically designed to be hand-held in the area of patient dental exams. The Department shall maintain a list of hand-held dental units that are approved for clinical exams in New York City, or may accept the list of such hand-held dental units as approved by New York State Department of Health, at the Department’s discretion.

The useful x-ray beam must be limited to the area of clinical interest. For x-ray units not utilizing PBL systems for clinical imaging and not using cones or diaphragms for beam restriction, the clinical x-ray field must be less than size of the image receptor on four of four sides of the image receptor. For all digital image receptors, the size of the clinical image must not be digitally manipulated as to render its original dimensions different from the clinical image size when the image is archived.

Consideration must be given to selecting the appropriate technique and employing available dose reduction methods and technologies across all patient sizes and clinical indications. For registrants utilizing manual selection of technique settings for clinical x-ray exams, this means a technique chart that employs technique settings for thin, average and heavy patient sizes. In the case where children less than 18 years of age are radiographed, the minimal technique setting should correspond to patients of 1-years old, 5-years old and 10-years old for exams most likely to be administered, e.g., AP chest and abdomen exams. In all such cases, the Entrance Skin Exposure (ESE) must be directly or indirectly determined for all clinical techniques set. At a minimum, these technique charts along with ESEs must include:

patient's (adult and pediatric, if appropriate) body part and anatomical size;

technique factors;

type of image receptor used;

source to image receptor distance used (except for dental intraoral radiography), and

position of the grid for the x-ray exam, i.e., the grid is either removed from the x-ray beam or is in the x-ray beam.

A facility must have a documented procedure in place for verification of patient identity and exam to be performed, including identification of the appropriate body part.

The registrant must create and make available to x-ray operators written safety procedures, including instructions for patient holding and any restrictions of the operating technique required for the safe operation of the particular x-ray system. The operator must be able to demonstrate familiarity with these procedures. Patient holding must be restricted to radiographic examinations with the exception that holding of patients shall be prohibited for all fluoroscopic exams and patient CT exams with the exception of hospital emergency rooms and hospital trauma centers.

The registrant must restrict the presence of individuals in the x-ray room of the patient being examined to those required or in training for the medical procedure, or the parent or guardian of a patient while the x-ray tube is energized. Other than the patient being examined, the following applies to all individuals in the x-ray room:

all persons must be positioned such that no part of the body will be struck by the useful beam unless protected by not less than 0.25 millimeter lead equivalent material;

If the procedure results in secondary or scatter radiation in excess of 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour at the position of these persons, they must be protected from the direct scatter radiation by whole body protective barriers of not less than 0.25 millimeter lead equivalent material or must be positioned so that the 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour limit is met.

Individuals must not be exposed to the useful beam except for healing arts purposes and unless such exposure has been authorized by a professional practitioner of the healing arts. This provision specifically prohibits deliberate exposure for the following purposes:

exposure of an individual for training, demonstration, or other non-healing arts purposes; and

exposure of an individual for the purpose of healing arts screening except as authorized by the Department.

X-ray patient logbook. Each facility must maintain a written or electronic record containing the patient's name, the type of examinations, and the dates the examinations were performed for all radiographic (except dental, podiatric and veterinary exams) and fluoroscopic patient exams. The administration of contrast agents as part of the patient exam must be noted in the patient logbook to state that IV contrast was administered. All adverse effects to injected contrast agents must be reported to the NY State Health Department, as required by law.

Sealing x-ray equipment. Sealing of x-ray units must be done only by the Department for x-ray units, of any type, that poses a hazard to the patient or the operator. No x-ray units sealed by the Department shall be put in use for clinical exams without the approval of the Department.

Leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly. The leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly measured at a distance of 1 meter in any direction from the source must not exceed

0.88 milligray (mGy) air kerma (vice 100 milliroentgen (mR) exposure) in 1 hour when the x-ray tube is operated at its leakage technique factors. If the maximum rated peak tube potential of the tube housing assembly is greater than the maximum rated peak tube potential for the diagnostic source assembly, positive means must be provided to limit the maximum x-ray tube potential to that of the diagnostic source assembly.

Technique indicators.

For x-ray equipment capable of displaying technique factors, the technique factors to be used during an exposure must be indicated before the exposure begins. If automatic exposure controls are used, the technique factors which are set prior to the exposure must be indicated.

The requirement of paragraph (1) of this subdivision may be met by permanent markings on equipment having fixed technique factors. Indication of technique factors must be visible from the operator's position except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist.

The accuracy of the technique factors for the x-ray unit (e.g., indicated kilovoltage peak (kVp), timer accuracy) must meet manufacturer specifications. In the absence of a manufacturer specification, the technique factor accuracy must be within ±10 percent.

Beam quality.

The half value layer (HVL) of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential shall not be less than the values shown in Table 1 of this subdivision. If it is necessary to determine such half-value layer at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in Table 1, linear interpolation or extrapolation may be made. Positive means must be provided to ensure that at least the minimum filtration needed to achieve beam quality requirements is in the useful beam during each exposure. In the case of a system which is to be operated with more than one thickness of filtration, this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector which will prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in place. In no case shall an x-ray unit failing to meet the minimum filtration standards in Table 1 conduct clinical patient exams until the x-ray unit is in compliance with Table 1.

Measuring compliance. For capacitor energy storage equipment, compliance shall be determined with the maximum selectable quantity of charge per exposure.

Battery charge indicator. On battery-powered generators, visual means must be provided on the control panel to indicate whether the battery is in a state of charge adequate for proper operation.

Modification of certified diagnostic x-ray components and systems.

Diagnostic x-ray components and systems certified in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1020 must not be modified except with certified components.

The owner who causes such modification must record the date and the details of the modification in the system records and maintain this information, and the modification of the x-ray system must not result in a failure to comply with this Article.

Multiple tubes. Where two or more radiographic tubes are controlled by one exposure switch, the tube which has been selected must be clearly indicated prior to initiation of the exposure. Only the selected tube can be energized. This indication must be both on the x-ray control panel and at or near the tube housing assembly which has been selected.

Mechanical support of tube head. The tube housing assembly supports must be adjusted such that the tube housing assembly will remain stable during an exposure unless tube housing movement is a designed function of the x-ray system.

Locks. All position locking, holding, and centering devices on x-ray system components and systems must function as intended.

(aa)Maintaining compliance. Diagnostic x-ray systems and their associated components used on humans and certified pursuant to the Federal Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray Systems (21 CFR

§1020.30) must be maintained in compliance with applicable requirements of that standard.

## §175.48 Specific requirements for radiographic x-ray equipment.

The requirements of this section apply to all non-dental registrants using diagnostic x-ray equipment.

Acceptance testing. Each registrant must have acceptance testing conducted on all radiographic x-ray units with the exception of dental, podiatric, and bone densitometer units, prior to clinical patient exams being conducted with the designated x-ray units. The acceptance testing must be conducted by a QMP and the report must be provided to the registrant. All non-compliance issues noted in this report must be corrected prior to clinical use of the unit. The acceptance testing report must verify the stated manufacturer’s tolerances for all machine testing. If manufacturer tolerances are absent, the registrant’s QMP must develop tolerances that must be used in subsequent QA testing by the registrant and must be so noted in the quality assurance manual.

Control and indication of technique factors.

Timers. Means must be provided to terminate the exposure at a preset time interval, a preset product of current and time, a preset number of pulses, or a preset radiation exposure to the image receptor.

Except during serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the exposure at any time during an exposure of greater than one-half second. Except during panoramic dental radiography, termination of exposure must cause automatic resetting of the timer to its initial setting or to zero. It must not be possible to make an exposure when the timer is set to a zero or off position if either position is provided.

During serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the x-ray exposure at any time, but means may be provided to permit completion of any single exposure of the series in process.

Automatic exposure controls. When an automatic exposure control is provided:

indication must be made on the control panel when this mode of operation is selected;

when the x-ray tube potential is equal to or greater than 51 kilovolts peak (kVp), the minimum exposure time for field emission equipment rated for pulse operation must be equal to or less than a time interval equivalent to two pulses and the minimum exposure time for all other equipment must be equal to or less than 1/60 second or a time interval required to deliver 5 milliampere-seconds (mAs), whichever is greater;

either the product of peak x-ray tube potential, current, and exposure time must be limited to not more than 60 kilowatt-seconds (kWs) per exposure or the product of x-ray tube current and exposure time must be limited to not more than 600 mAs per exposure, except when the x-ray tube potential is less than 51 kVp, in which case the product of x-ray tube current and exposure time must be limited to not more than 2,000 mAs per exposure; and

a visible signal must indicate when an exposure has been terminated at the limits described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and manual resetting must be required before further automatically timed exposures can be made.

Reproducibility.

Coefficient of variation. For any specific combination of selected technique factors, the estimated coefficient of variation of the air kerma must be no greater than 0.05.

Measuring compliance. Determination of compliance must be based on 10 consecutive measurements taken within a time period of 1 hour. Equipment manufactured after September 5, 1978, must also have all variable controls for technique factors adjusted to alternate settings and reset to the test setting after each measurement. For equipment having automatic exposure controls, compliance shall be determined with a sufficient thickness of attenuating material in the useful beam such that the technique factors can be adjusted to provide individual exposures of a minimum of 12 pulses on field emission equipment rated for pulsed operation or no less than one-tenth second per exposure on all other equipment.

Alternatively, the reproducibility of any technique value may be determined by taking 5 consecutive measurements and utilizing the formula given below:

Reproducibility = (maximum measured value – minimum measured value) Average of the measured five values

The calculated reproducibility shall be equal to ± 10percent for compliance.

Linearity. The following requirements apply for any fixed x-ray tube potential within the range of 40 percent to 100 percent of the maximum rated. In regard to paragraphs (1) through (3) in this subdivision below, measurements can be made in mR instead of mGy.

Equipment having independent selection of x-ray tube current (mA). The average ratios of air kerma to the indicated milliampere-seconds product (mGy/mAs) obtained at any two consecutive tube current settings must not differ by more than 0.10 times their sum. This is: ׀X1 – X2׀ ≤ 0.10(X1 + X2); where X1 and X2 are the average mGy/mAs values obtained at each of two consecutive mAs selector settings or at two settings differing by no more than a factor of 2 where the mAs selector provides continuous selection.

Equipment having selection of x-ray tube current-exposure time product (mAs). For equipment manufactured after May 3, 1994, the average ratios of air kerma to the indicated milliampere-seconds product (mGy/mAs) obtained at any two consecutive mAs selector settings must not

differ by more than 0.10 times their sum. This is: ׀X1 – X20.10≤ ׀(X1 + X2); where X1 and X2

are the average mGy/mAs values obtained at each of two consecutive mAs selector settings or at two settings differing by no more than a factor of 2 where the mAs selector provides continuous selection.

Measuring compliance. Determination of compliance will be based on at least 3 exposures, made within 1 hour, at each of the two settings. These two settings may include any two focal spot sizes except where one is equal to or less than 0.45 mm and the other is greater than 0.45 mm. For purposes of this requirement, focal spot size is the focal spot size specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer.

Field limitation and alignment for mobile, portable, and stationary general purpose x-ray systems. Except when spot-film devices are in service, mobile, portable, and stationary general purpose radiographic x-ray systems must meet the following requirements:

Variable x-ray field limitation. A means for stepless adjustment of the size of the x-ray field must be provided. Each dimension of the minimum field size at an SID of 100 cm must be equal to or less than 5 cm.

Visual definition.

Means for visually defining the perimeter of the x-ray field must be provided. The total misalignment of the edges of the visually defined field with the respective edges of the x-ray field along either the length or width of the visually defined field must not exceed 2 percent

of the distance from the source to the center of the visually defined field when the surface upon which it appears is perpendicular to the axis of the x-ray beam.

When a light localizer is used to define the x-ray field, it must provide an average illuminance of not less than 160 lux (15 footcandles) at 100 cm or at the maximum SID, whichever is less. The average illuminance shall be based on measurements made in the approximate center of each quadrant of the light field. Radiation therapy simulation systems are exempt from this requirement.

The edge of the light field at 100 cm or at the maximum SID, whichever is less, must have a contrast ratio, corrected for ambient lighting, of not less than 4 in the case of beam-limiting devices designed for use on stationary equipment, and a contrast ratio of not less than 3 in the case of beam-limiting devices designed for use on mobile and portable equipment. The contrast ratio is defined as I1/I2, where I1 is the illuminance 3 mm from the edge of the light field toward the center of the field; and I2 is the illuminance 3 mm from the edge of the light field away from the center of the field..

Field indication and alignment on stationary general purpose x-ray equipment. Except when spot-film devices are in service, stationary general purpose x-ray systems must meet the following requirements, in addition to those prescribed in subdivision (e) of this section:

Means must be provided to indicate when the axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor, to align the center of the x-ray field with respect to the center of the image receptor to within 2 percent of the SID, and to indicate the SID to within 2 percent;

The beam-limiting device must numerically indicate the field size in the plane of the image receptor to which it is adjusted;

Indication of field size dimensions and SIDs must be specified in centimeters or inches and must be such that aperture adjustments result in x-ray field dimensions in the plane of the image receptor which correspond to those indicated by the beam-limiting device to within 2 percent of the SID when the beam axis is indicated to be perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor; and

Compliance measurements will be made at each SID in common clinical use (such as SIDs of 100, 150, and 200 cm or 36, 40, 48, 72 inches) and with at least one of the commonly used image

receptor dimensions (such as nominal image receptor dimensions of 13, 18, 24, 30, 35, 40, and 43 cm or 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17 inches), or at any other specific dimensions at which the beam-limiting device or its associated diagnostic x-ray system is uniquely designed to operate.

Field limitation on x-ray equipment other than general purpose radiographic systems.

X-ray systems designed for one image receptor size. Radiographic equipment designed for only one image receptor size at a fixed SID must be provided with means to limit the field at the plane of the image receptor to dimensions no greater than those of the image receptor, and to align the center of the x-ray field with the center of image receptor to within 2 percent of the SID, or must be provided with means to both size and align the x-ray field such that the x-ray field at the plane of the image receptor does not extend beyond the edge of the image receptor.

Other x-ray systems. Radiographic systems not specifically covered in subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section, and paragraph (1) of this subdivision, which are also designed for use with extraoral image receptors and when used with an extraoral image receptor, must be provided with means to limit the x-ray field in the plane of the image receptor so that such field does not exceed each dimension of the image receptor by more than 2 percent of the SID, when the axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor. In addition, means must be provided to align the center of the x-ray field with the center of the image receptor to within 2 percent of the SID, or means must be provided to both size and align the x-ray field such that the x-ray field at the plane of the image receptor does not extend beyond any edge of the image receptor. These requirements may be met with:

A system which performs in accordance with subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section or when alignment means are also provided, may be met with either;

An assortment of removable, fixed-aperture, beam-limiting devices sufficient to meet the requirement for each combination of image receptor size and SID for which the unit is designed. Each such device must have clear and permanent markings to indicate the image receptor size and SID for which it is designed; or

A beam-limiting device having multiple fixed apertures sufficient to meet the requirement for each combination of image receptor size and SID for which the unit is designed. Permanent, clearly legible markings must indicate the image receptor size and SID for which each aperture is designed and must indicate which aperture is in position for use.

Positive beam limitation (PBL). The requirements of this subdivision apply to radiographic systems which contain PBL and which the registrant has not disabled.

Field size. When a PBL system is provided, it must prevent x-ray production when:

Either the length or width of the x-ray field in the plane of the image receptor differs from the corresponding image receptor dimension by more than 3 percent of the SID; or

The sum of the length and width differences stated in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph without regard to sign exceeds 4 percent of the SID.

The beam-limiting device is at an SID for which PBL is not designed for sizing.

Conditions for PBL. When provided and if the registrant has not disabled it, the PBL system must function as described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. whenever all the following conditions are met:

The image receptor is inserted into a permanently mounted cassette holder;

The image receptor length and width are less than 50 cm;

The x-ray beam axis is within ±3 degrees of vertical and the SID is 90 cm to 130 cm inclusive; or the x-ray beam axis is within ±3 degrees of horizontal and the SID is 90 cm to 205 cm inclusive;

The x-ray beam axis is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor to within ±3 degrees; and

Neither tomographic nor stereoscopic radiography is being performed.

Measuring compliance. Compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be determined when the equipment indicates that the beam axis is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor and the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision are met. Compliance shall be determined no sooner than 5 seconds after insertion of the image receptor.

Operator initiated undersizing. The PBL system must be capable of operating such that, at the discretion of the operator, the size of the field may be made smaller than the size of the image receptor through stepless adjustment of the field size. Each dimension of the minimum field size at an SID of 100 cm must be equal to or less than 5 cm. Return to PBL function as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must occur automatically upon any change of image receptor size or SID.

Override of PBL. A capability may be provided for overriding PBL in case of system failure and for servicing the system. This override may be for all SIDs and image receptor sizes. A key must be required for any override capability that is accessible to the operator. It must not be possible to remove the key while PBL is overridden. Each such key switch or key must be clearly and durably labeled as follows: "For X-Ray Field Limitation System Failure".

The override capability is considered accessible to the operator if it is referenced in the operator’s manual or in other material intended for the operator or if its location is such that the operator would consider it part of the operational controls.

Disabling of PBL. A facility has the option to permanently functionally disable a PBL system. When this option is chosen, the standards for manual collimation apply.

Source-skin distance. The minimum source-skin distance must not be less than 30 cm, except

intraoral dental equipment regardless of clinical or veterinary use.

Radiation from capacitor energy storage equipment. Radiation emitted from the x-ray tube must not

exceed:

an air kerma of 0.26 microGy (vice 0.03 mR exposure) in 1 minute at 5 cm from any accessible

surface of the diagnostic source assembly, with the beam-limiting device fully open, the system

fully charged, and the exposure switch, timer, or any discharge mechanism not activated; and

an air kerma of 0.88 mGy (vice 100 mR exposure) in one hour at 100 cm from the x-ray source,

with beam-limiting device fully open, when the system is discharged through the x-ray tube either

manually or automatically by use of a discharge switch or deactivation of the input power.

Compliance shall be determined by measurements of the maximum air kerma per discharge

multiplied by the total number of discharges in 1 hour (duty cycle).

Tube stands for portable x-ray systems. Except during veterinary field operations where it is impractical to do so, a tube stand or other mechanical support must be used for portable x-ray systems, so that the x-ray tube housing assembly need not be hand-held during an exposure.

Conditions of use.

The x-ray image receptor used as recording medium during the x-ray examination must show visual evidence of cut-off (beam delineation) on all four sides of the x-ray image. This applies to all x-ray units using manual collimation and where no positive means are used to contain the x-ray field to the size of the image receptor. The x-ray image receptor can be film or digital image receptors.

Personnel monitoring must be required for all persons operating mobile or portable x-ray equipment, except hand-held dental x-ray units.

No person shall be regularly employed to hold patients during exposures nor shall such duty be performed by an individual occupationally exposed to radiation in the course of that individual's other duties. When it is necessary to immobilize the patient, mechanical supporting or immobilizing devices should be used. Written safety procedures must provide the selection criteria for the holder and protocol to be followed during the patient holding procedure.

If patients must be held by an individual, that individual must be instructed in personal radiation safety and must be protected with appropriate shielding devices such as protective gloves and a protective garment of at least 0.25 mm lead equivalent. No part of the holding individual's body shall be in the useful beam. The exposure of any individual used for holding patients must be monitored.

For patients who have not passed the reproductive age, gonadal shielding of not less than 0.5 mm lead equivalent must be used during radiographic procedures in which the gonads are in the useful beam, except for cases in which this would interfere with the diagnostic procedure.

Pregnant women and individuals under 18 years of age must not hold patients under any

conditions.

## §175.49Specific requirements for dental facilities.

The following specific quality assurance requirements apply to a dental facility:

If using a filmless system, maintain and operate PSP and DDR systems according to manufacturer specifications.

The registrant must provide initial training and annual evaluations of x-ray operators to include but not limited to: positioning of the x-ray tube, image processing, operator location during x-ray exposure, source to skin distance, radiation protection, appropriate radiographic protocol and applicable regulatory requirements. Records of training and annual evaluations must be maintained for inspection by the Department.

Warning label.

On systems manufactured on or before June 10, 2006, the control panel containing the main power switch must bear the following warning statement, or the warning statement in paragraph

of this subdivision, legible and accessible to view: "WARNING: This x-ray unit may be

dangerous to patient and operator unless safe exposure factors and operating instructions are observed."

(2) On systems manufactured after June 10, 2006, the control panel containing the main power switch must bear the warning statement, legible and accessible to view: "WARNING: This x-ray unit may be dangerous to patient and operator unless safe exposure factors, operating instructions and maintenance schedules are observed."

Radiation exposure control. Means must be provided to initiate the radiation exposure by a deliberate action on the part of the operator, such as the depression of a switch. Radiation exposure must not be initiated without such an action.

Exposure control location and operator protection. Except for units designed to be hand-held, the exposure control must allow the operator to be:

behind a protective barrier at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall, or

at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the tube housing assembly, outside the path of the useful x-ray

beam, while making exposures.

Administrative controls.

Patient and image receptor holding devices must be used when the techniques permit.

Except for units designed to be hand-held, the tube housing and position indicating device (PID) must not be hand-held during an exposure.

Hand-held intraoral equipment. In addition to other requirements in this Article, the following applies specifically to hand-held devices:

## §175.47(j)) apply.

Fluoroscopic installations: equipment.

Equipment must be so constructed that the entire cross-section of the useful beam is always intercepted by a primary protective barrier regardless of the panel-screen distance. For conventional fluoroscopes, this requirement may be assumed to have been met if, when the collimating system is opened to its fullest extent, an unilluminated margin is left on all edges of the fluorescent screen regardless of the position of the screen during use.

The acceptance testing must be conducted by a QMP and the report provided to the registrant. All non-compliance issues noted in this report must be corrected prior to clinical use of the unit. The acceptance testing report must verify the stated manufacturer’s tolerances for all machine testing. If manufacturer tolerances are absent, the QMP must develop tolerances that must be used in subsequent quality assurance testing by the registrant and must be so noted in the facility’s quality assurance manual.

Primary protective barrier.

Limitation of useful beam. The fluoroscopic imaging assembly must be provided with a primary protective barrier which intercepts the entire cross section of the useful beam at any SID. The x-ray tube used for fluoroscopy must not produce x-rays unless the barrier is in position to intercept the entire useful beam. The AKR due to transmission through the barrier with the attenuation block in the useful beam combined with radiation from the fluoroscopic imaging receptor must not exceed 3.34x10-3 percent of the entrance AKR, at a distance of 10 cm from any accessible surface of the fluoroscopic imaging assembly beyond the plane of the image receptor. Radiation therapy simulation systems are exempt from this requirement provided the systems are intended only for remote control operation.

Measuring compliance. The AKR must be measured in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section. If the source is below the tabletop, the measurement must be made with the input surface of the fluoroscopic imaging assembly positioned 30 cm above the tabletop. If the source is above the tabletop and the SID is variable, the measurement must be made with the end of the beam-limiting device or spacer as close to the tabletop as it can be placed, provided that it is not closer than 30 cm. Movable grids and compression devices must be removed from the useful beam during the measurement. For all measurements, the attenuation block must be positioned in the

useful beam 10 cm from the point of measurement of entrance AKR and between this point and the input surface of the fluoroscopic imaging assembly.

Field limitation.

Angulation. For fluoroscopic equipment manufactured after February 25, 1978, when the angle between the image receptor and the beam axis of the x-ray beam is variable, means must be provided to indicate when the axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor. Compliance with subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section shall be determined with the beam axis indicated to be perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor.

Further means for limitation. Means must be provided to permit further limitation of the x-ray field to sizes smaller than the limits of subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section. Beam-limiting devices manufactured after May 22, 1979, and incorporated in equipment with a variable SID or capability of a visible area of greater than 300 cm2, must be provided with means for stepless adjustment of the x-ray field. Equipment with a fixed SID and the capability of a visible area of no greater than 300 cm2 must be provided with either stepless adjustment of the x-ray field or with a means to further limit the x-ray field size at the plane of the image receptor to 125 cm2 or less. Stepless adjustment must, at the greatest SID, provide continuous field sizes from the maximum obtainable to a field size containable in a square of 5 cm by 5 cm.

## Spot-film devices. In addition to the applicable requirements of §§175.47 and 175.48, the following requirements also apply to spot-film devices, except when the spot-film device is provided for use with a radiation therapy simulation system:

Means must be provided between the source and the patient for adjustment of the x-ray field size in the plane of the image receptor to the size of that portion of the image receptor which has been selected on the spot-film selector. Such adjustment must be accomplished automatically when the x-ray field size in the plane of the image receptor is greater than the selected portion of the image receptor. If the x-ray field size is less than the size of the selected portion of the image receptor, the field size must not open automatically to the size of the selected portion of the image receptor unless the operator has selected that mode of operation.

Neither the length nor width of the x-ray field in the plane of the image receptor shall differ from the corresponding dimensions of the selected portion of the image receptor by more than 3 percent of the SID when adjusted for full coverage of the selected portion of the image receptor. The sum, without regard to sign, of the length and width differences must not exceed 4 percent of the SID. On spot-film devices manufactured after February 25, 1978, if the angle between the plane of the image receptor and beam axis is variable, means must be provided to indicate when the axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor. Compliance shall be determined with the beam axis indicated to be perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor.

The center of the x-ray field in the plane of the image receptor must be aligned with the center of the selected portion of the image receptor to within 2 percent of the SID.

Means must be provided to reduce the x-ray field size in the plane of the image receptor to a size smaller than the selected portion of the image receptor such that:

for spot-film devices used on fixed-SID fluoroscopic systems which are not required to, and do not provide stepless adjustment of the x-ray field, the minimum field size, at the greatest SID, does not exceed 125 square cm; or

for spot-film devices used on fluoroscopic systems that have a variable SID or stepless adjustment of the field size, the minimum field size, at the greatest SID, must be containable in a square of 5 cm by 5 cm.

A capability may be provided for overriding the automatic x-ray field size adjustment in case of system failure. If it is so provided, a signal visible at the fluoroscopist’s position must indicate whenever the automatic x-ray field size adjustment override is engaged. Each such system failure override switch must be clearly labeled as follows: "For X-ray Field Limitation System Failure".

For rectangular x-ray fields used with circular image receptors, the error in alignment shall be determined along the length and width dimensions of the x-ray field which pass through the center of the visible area of the image receptor.

For fluoroscopic equipment manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, other than radiation simulation systems, the maximum area of the x-ray field in the plane of the image receptor must conform with one of the following requirements:

When any linear dimension of the visible area of the image receptor measured through the center of the visible area is less than or equal to 34 cm in any direction, the x-ray field measured along the direction of greatest misalignment with the visible area of the image receptor does not extend beyond the edge of the visible area of the image receptor by more than 1.5 cm, or

When any linear dimension of the visible area of the image receptor measured through the center of the visible area is greater than 34 cm in any direction, the x-ray field measured along the direction of greatest misalignment with the visible area of the image receptor does not extend beyond the edge of the visible area of the image receptor by more than 2 cm.

Fluoroscopy and radiography using fluoroscopic imaging assembly with inherently rectangular image receptors. For x-ray systems manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, the following applies:

The error in alignment shall be determined along the length and width dimensions of the x-ray field which pass through the center of the visible area of the image receptor.

Override capability. If the fluoroscopic x-ray field size is adjusted automatically as the SID or image receptor size is changed, a capability may be provided for overriding the automatic adjustment in case of system failure. If it is so provided, a signal visible at the fluoroscopist’s position must indicate whenever the automatic field adjustment is overridden. Each such system failure override switch must be clearly labeled as follows: "For X-Ray Field Limitation System Failure".

Activation of tube. X-ray production in the fluoroscopic mode must be controlled by a device which requires continuous pressure by the operator for the entire time of any exposure. When recording serial radiographic images from the fluoroscopic image receptor, the operator must be able to terminate the x-ray exposure at any time, but means may be provided to permit completion of any single exposure of the series in process.

For an LIH image obtained by initiating a separate radiographic-like exposure at the termination of fluoroscopic imaging, the technique factors for the LIH image must be

selectable prior to the fluoroscopic exposure, and the combination selected must be indicated prior to initiation of the fluoroscopic exposure.

Means must be provided to clearly indicate to the user whether a displayed image is the LIH radiograph or fluoroscopy. Display of the LIH radiograph must be replaced by the fluoroscopic image concurrently with re-initiation of fluoroscopic exposure, unless separate displays are provided for the LIH radiograph and fluoroscopic images.

Displays of values of AKR and cumulative air kerma. Fluoroscopic equipment manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, must display at the fluoroscopist’s working position the AKR and cumulative air kerma. The following requirements apply for each x-ray tube used during an examination or procedure:

When the x-ray tube is activated and the number of images produced per unit time is greater than 6 images per second, the AKR in mGy/min must be continuously displayed and continually updated.

The cumulative air kerma in units of mGy must be displayed either within 5 seconds of termination of an exposure or displayed continuously and regularly updated.

The display of the AKR must be clearly distinguishable from the display of the cumulative air kerma.

The AKR and cumulative air kerma must represent the value for conditions of free-in-air irradiation at one of the following reference locations specified according to the type of fluoroscope.

For fluoroscopes with x-ray source below the x-ray table, x-ray source above the table, or of lateral type, the reference location must be the respective locations specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (v) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (m) of this section.

For C-arm fluoroscopes, the reference location must be 15 cm from the isocenter toward the x-ray source along the beam axis. Alternatively, the reference location must be at a point specified by the manufacturer to represent the location of the intersection of the x-ray beam with the patient’s skin.

Means must be provided to reset to zero the display of cumulative air kerma prior to the commencement of a new examination or procedure.

The displayed AKR and cumulative air kerma must not deviate from the actual values by more than ±35 percent over the range of 6 mGy/min and 100 mGy to the maximum indication of AKR and cumulative air kerma, respectively. Compliance shall be determined with an irradiation time greater than 3 seconds.

Protection from scatter radiation.

For stationary fluoroscopic systems, ancillary shielding, such as drapes, self-supporting curtains, or viewing shields, must be available and used as supplemental protection for all individuals other than the patient in the room during a fluoroscopy procedure.

Each CT x-ray system must be equipped to allow two-way aural communication between the patient and the operator at the control panel.

Each CT x-ray system must be equipped with windows, mirrors, closed-circuit television, or an equivalent to permit continuous visual observation of the patient during CT scanning by the CT operator from the control panel.

When the primary viewing system is by electronic means, an alternate viewing system (which may be electronic) must be available for if the primary viewing system fails.

Determination of the CT unit radiation output.

Each registrant must ensure that the measurement of the radiation output of each CT x-ray system that it operates is performed by, or under the direction of, a QMP and the output measurement must be conducted following the guidelines of the facility’s accreditation as to methodology and as to setting scan techniques and CT unit technique settings.

Each registrant must maintain and make available for review by the Department, on the premises of its radiation installation where a CT x-ray system is located, written procedures for the appropriate output measurement of the CT x-ray system.

After initial installation, the CT x-ray system radiation output must be determined prior to its use on human beings and re-measured at least every 12 months thereafter. Any change or replacement of components of a CT x-ray system which could cause a change in the radiation output will require a re-measurement within 30 days of component installation under the supervision of a QMP operating within their scope of practice. If the accreditation body does not dictate the criteria for re-measurement based upon CT component replacement, then the facility must establish these criteria in conjunction with the QMP and CT service engineer, including the list of components that dictate a re-measurement, and this protocol must be documented in the facility’s QA Manual.

The measurement of the radiation output of a CT x-ray system must be performed with a calibrated dosimetry system. This system must have been calibrated either by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or traceable to NIST or equivalent standards organization. The calibration must have been performed within the previous 12 months and after any servicing that might have affected system calibration,

The CT dosimetry phantoms must meet the following specifications and conditions of use:

any effects on the doses measured because of the removal of phantom material to accommodate dosimeters must be accounted for through appropriate corrections to the reported data or included in the statement of maximum deviation for the values obtained using the phantom; and

all dose measurements must be performed with the CT dosimetry phantom simulating an adult abdomen or adult head placed on the patient couch or support device without additional attenuation materials present.

the requirements of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph can also be met by using an alternative method of radiation measurement and calculation published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and acceptable to the Department.

Records of radiation output determinations performed must be maintained for 3 years at the radiation installation where the CT is located.

Quality assurance testing.

Each registrant possessing one or more CT units shall be deemed a large facility.

Regardless of the number of patient exams conducted per year all Quality Assurance (QA) tests for existing x-ray equipment on site must be done on a frequency for a large facility. As such, each registrant must have a QA committee that meets at least semi-annually and such committee must be comprised of the medical professionals associated with the registrant’s facility, including the QMP or a representative conducting the accreditation for the facility, the Radiation Safety Officer for the facility, and whatever additional facility titles that the accreditation body mandates to be present for such meetings.

Each registrant must maintain a QA manual that contains written procedures for all testing and meet the requirements of the facility’s accreditation body for maintaining a QA program as to what QA must be done and their mandated testing frequency. The CT Quality Assurance procedures must have been developed under the direction of a QMP and radiologist and be approved by the registrant’s QA committee.

The QA procedures must incorporate the use of one or more phantoms approved by the facility’s accreditation body and must be imaged according to the accreditation body’s recommendations. If the accreditation body does not provides tolerances for daily CT QA tests, then the facility must follow the manufacturer’s specifications for daily CT QA tests and utilization of the manufacturer’s phantom for such daily testing. The QA testing of the phantom must have the capability of providing an indication of contrast scale, noise, the resolution capability of the system for low and high contrast objects, and measuring the mean CT Number for water or other reference material and uniformity. All of the aforementioned image quality parameters must be evaluated at least semi-annually by a QMP and presented to the QA Committee for their review and approval.

Written records of the QA checks performed by the registrant must be maintained for review by the Department for at least 5 years.

QA checks must include the following:

## images obtained from x-ray scanning of the CT phantom pursuant to §175.55(d)(4) must be retained as electronic copies stored within the CT x-ray system or stored in the facility’s Picture Archiving and Communication (PACS) system, if these images are available based on the CT system.

dose assessment for the most common CT examinations that are performed on the system for which reference levels have been published by the American College of Radiology (ACR), the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) or the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) for pediatric head, pediatric abdomen, adult head and adult abdomen.

for brain perfusion studies clinically conducted at the registrant’s facility, the registrant must have on an annual basis the clinical dose measured by a QMP and an annual evaluation and approval of the clinical protocols for such brain perfusion studies by the registrant’s Radiation Protocol Committee (RPC), or Radiation Safety Committee (RSC), if the RSC assumes the responsibilities of the RPC. The facility must investigate and document the clinical necessity of brain perfusion CTDIvol doses greater than 100 rads (1 Gray) or whatever guidance dose is so stated in the ACR-ASNR-SPR Practice Parameters for the Performance of CT Perfusion in Neurological Imaging (Amended 2014) or superseding documents.

for each CT unit possessing dose adjustment software features for dose adjustment in clinical patient scans:

the facility must conduct measurements to determine that the dose adjustment software is functioning as the manufacturer specified to adjust the CT imaging techniques so as to maintain image quality.

this must be conducted at least annually or whenever there is a software upgrade or change to the dose adjustment software of the CT software.

for verification testing as required by clause (A) of this subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (6) of this subdivision, manufacturer test results with documentation and formal report shall be acceptable to verify compliance.

For CT units used for treatment planning simulation, the registrant must conduct the following QA testing, in addition to daily QA tests mandated by the accreditation agency, if the site is accredited:

daily measurements to verify that image reconstruction dimensions or scaling accuracy are accurate to manufacturer’s tolerances.

daily verification of the CT number uniformity for the manufacturer’s water phantom and verify compliance with the manufacturer’s tolerances. In this context, CT number uniformity must be conducted for the four quadrants of the water phantom image and compliance shall be determined by comparison between the outer four quadrants and the center of the water phantom as per manufacturer’s tolerances.

measure each month the CT number uniformity for a variety of materials with densities above and below that of water and verify compliance with the accreditation body standards or manufacturer specifications.

the registrant can follow the accreditation body’s guidelines for the conduct of such measurements and tolerances for such, but the frequency of conduct must be as stated in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph.

Operating procedures and policies.

All diagnostic CT and CBCT units for human use must be accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by the Department. This requirement does not apply to CBCT units used at dental facilities and to CT units used solely for simulation of patients for radiation therapy.

Effective January 1, 2021, new registrants must be accreditedbut must demonstrate that they have initiated the accreditation process within 90 days of the start of operations.

Registrants, possessing CT units that have been notified by accrediting agencies that their CT units do not meet minimum standards to be accredited, must notify the Department within 30 days of such notice.

A facility performing CT that has an existing accreditation revoked, repealed, or otherwise terminated for any reason, must report such occurrence to the Department within 30 days.

The CT x-ray system must not be operated on a human being except by a physician or by a licensed radiologic technologist who has been specifically trained in the operation of the CT system. To meet compliance with this section, each facility must maintain documentation that each physician or LRT operator of the facility’s CT units have received training on the specific manufacturer model that the facility possesses.

The registrant must ensure that each CT x-ray system has a radiation protection survey for assessment of exposure to persons in controlled and non-controlled areas made at the time of installation. Any change in the installation that compromises the original integrity of the facility’s shielding and installation of a new CT unit shall require an additional radiation protection survey to verify compliance with Article standards for radiation protection doses to the public and radiation workers.

Each CT x-ray system must have available at the control panel the operation and output determination of the CT x-ray system which must include:

dates of the latest output determination and QA checks and the location within the facility where the results of those tests may be obtained;

instructions on the use of the CT image quality phantoms including a schedule of QA tests that are appropriate for the system as determined by the manufacturer, allowable variations for the indicated parameters.

For each CT scanner in a facility, a current set of default protocols are available at the control panel (either electronically or as a document) which specifies for each routine examination the CT conditions of operation and the slice thickness, spacing between slices or pitch. The default

protocols need not be the same as the clinically used scan protocols at the facility, but the clinically used protocols must be derived from the default protocols.

If the QA testing on the CT x-ray system identifies that a system operating parameter has exceeded a tolerance as specified in the Quality Assurance manual, use of the CT x-ray system on patients must be limited to those exceptions permitted by established written instructions of the licensed QMP or radiologist. Upon completion of corrective action, the QA testing must be repeated to verify that the system is back within tolerance.

All clinical CT scans must be free of any and all imaging artifacts that the CT facility discovers upon daily QA phantom testing. Upon discovery of any and all imaging artifacts by way of daily QA phantoms testing, the facility must cease clinical scans until corrective action has removed such artifacts being present in clinical scans, exception for all patient CT scans conducted on emergency cases such as in hospital emergency rooms or hospital trauma centers. All corrective actions must be documented by the registrant for review by the Department.

Effective July 1, 2020, each registrant performing CT scans on human beings must ensure that for

each scan, the radiation dose delivered by the scanner to a reference phantom or the dose received

by the patient or other dose metric is saved and recorded. The dose delivered must be recorded as

Computed Tomography Dose Index volume (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) or other

dosimetry metric published in the peer reviewed scientific literature and acceptable to the

Department.

The displayed dose must be verified on an annual basis by or under the supervision of a QMP to

ensure that the equipment manufacturer’s displayed dose is within 20percent of the measured

dose. To accomplish the latter, a phantom must be used for this measurement.

Each registrant that performs CT scans on human beings must establish and implement a policy and a procedure to ensure that a request for a CT scan originates from a licensed physician or other authorized professional practitioner familiar with the patient’s clinical condition. The request must include sufficient information to demonstrate the medical indication for the CT examination and allow for the proper performance and interpretation of the CT scan.

Each facility must maintain a patient logbook of all patients undergoing CT exams at the

facility. The logbook must contain the following information:

patient identification information,

CT scans performed along with the imaging parameters,

the CT manufacturer’s patient dose assessment, and

whether the study was conducted with contrast media.

The logbook can be in electronic format provided all information is readily available to the

Department during periodic inspections.

Additional requirements.

Radiation protection programs.

Each licensee must:

## provide a radiation safety officer pursuant to 10 CFR §§35.24 and 35.50 who shall be delegated authority to ensure the implementation of this radiation protection program and ensure radiation doses are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) (as defined in 10 CFR §20.1003 and more fully described in §175.105(c)(1)). The radiation safety officer or associate radiation safety officer named on the license, or an authorized user designated to act as the radiation safety officer in the radiation safety officer's absence, must be present on the premises at least 50 percent of the time that radioactive material is being handled or equipment containing radioactive material is being operated;

## provide for a radiation safety committee to administer the radiation protection program in medical centers, hospitals and institutions of higher education. The committee must include the facility operator or a person with the authority to act on behalf of the facility operator, and representation from departments within the facility where radiation sources are used. The committee must meet at least quarterly and must oversee all uses of radioactive materials within the facility, must review the activities of the radiation safety officer, and must review the radiation safety program at least annually. The committee, or a subcommittee, must oversee the administration of a quality assurance program as required by §175.108;

## provide a quality assurance program for diagnostic and therapeutic uses of radioactive materials pursuant to §175.108 and other applicable provisions of this Article; and

ensure that all personnel involved in planning for, or administering radiation doses to humans, or in the use of radioactive materials for other lawful purposes, are supervised, are instructed as described in 10 CFR §19.12 and are competent to safely use such radiation sources and services.

For non-human use radioactive materials installations, the radiation safety officer specified in

## §175.102(c)(1)(i)(A) must be:

a physicist certified by the American Board of Health Physics, the American Board of Radiology or the American Board of Medical Physics in a branch of physics related to the type and use of radioactive material in the installation; or

a person with equivalent training and experience as determined by the Department; or

an authorized user named on the radioactive materials license issued by the Department.

Individual monitoring.

In addition to the criteria in 10 CFR §20.1502(a)(2),(3), each licensee must monitor occupational exposure for minors and declared pregnant women likely to receive, in 1 year from sources external to the body, a deep dose equivalent in excess of 10 percent of any of the applicable limits in 10 CFR §§20.1201 or 20.1208.

A person supplying personnel monitoring devices to individuals pursuant to 10 CFR

§20.1502 must ensure that the individuals wear such devices as follows:

## An individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the whole body must be worn at the unshielded location of the whole body likely to receive the highest exposure, except when monitoring is performed in accordance with §175.17(b)(4).

An individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to an embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant worker pursuant to 10 CFR §20.1208 must be located at the waist under any protective garment worn by the declared pregnant worker.

An individual monitoring device used for monitoring the lens dose equivalent must be located at the neck outside any protective garment worn by the individual, or at an unshielded location closer to the eye.

An individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the extremities must be worn on the extremity likely to receive the highest exposure. The device must be oriented to measure the highest dose to the extremity being monitored.

The licensee must ensure that adequate precautions are taken to prevent a deceptive exposure of an individual monitoring device, and no licensee must remove an exposure from an individual's exposure record without prior authorization from the Department. The licensee must submit the dosimeter for processing with due diligence and in no event in excess of the time period specified by the manufacturer of the dosimeter.

Respiratory protection.

If the licensee uses respiratory protection equipment to limit intakes pursuant to 10 CFR

§§20.1701 through 20.1705, the licensee must issue a written policy statement on respirator usage covering:

the routine, non-routine, and emergency use of respirators; and

limitations on periods of respirator use and relief from respirator use; and

the use of process or other engineering controls, instead of respirators.

For a licensee to make allowance for respiratory equipment when estimating the exposure of individuals to airborne radioactive material, the following additional condition applies: the licensee selects respiratory protection equipment that provides a protection factor, specified in 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix A, greater than the multiple by which peak concentrations of airborne radioactive materials in the working area are expected to exceed the values specified in Table 1, Column 3 of 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix A. However, if the selection of respiratory protection equipment with a protection factor greater than this multiple of peak concentration is inconsistent with the goal specified in 10 CFR §20.1702 of keeping the total effective dose equivalent ALARA, the licensee may select respiratory protection equipment with a lower

protection factor provided that such a selection would result in a total effective dose equivalent that is ALARA. In estimating the dose to individuals from intake of airborne radioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when respirators are worn is initially assumed to be the ambient concentration in air without respiratory protection, divided by the assigned protection factor. If the dose is later found to be greater than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value must be used. If the dose is later found to be less than the initially estimated dose, the corrected value may be used.

Requirements for possession of sealed sources.

The licensee in possession of any sealed source must follow the radiation safety and leak testing requirements specified in 10 CFR §35.67.

Reports of test results for leaking or contaminated sealed sources must be made pursuant to 10 CFR §35.3067.

A licensee authorized for medical use in possession of a licensed sealed source or brachytherapy source must survey with a radiation survey instrument at intervals not to exceed 3 months all areas where such sources are stored. This shall not apply to sources in teletherapy units or gamma stereotactic radiosurgery units or to sealed sources in diagnostic devices.

Radioactive material must not be stored with either food or beverages.

No person shall bury any licensed radioactive material within New York City.

The provisions of 10 CFR §20.2005 do not authorize the licensed materials described to be disposed of inside the City as if they were not radioactive; however, these materials may be shipped for disposal outside of the City as if they were not radioactive provided that the receiving jurisdiction allows the disposal of such materials as if they were not radioactive.

Vacating premises. Each specific licensee must notify the Department in writing of intent to vacate not less than 30 days before vacating or relinquishing possession or control of premises which may have been contaminated with radioactive material as a result of licensed activities. When deemed necessary by the Department, the licensee must decontaminate the premises to such levels as the Department may specify.

Recordkeeping requirements for receipt, use, and disposition of radioactive material.

Each licensee must maintain records of the receipt, use, and disposition of radioactive material in units of becquerels or microcuries and must include from whom such materials were received and the ultimate disposition.

The licensee must retain these records for 3 years after the record is made.

The Department may order the removal, through an authorized person, or the surrender to the Department, of any radiation source by any person who:

does not hold, or continue to hold, a valid license issued by the Department; or

is not able or equipped, or who fails to observe with regard to such radiation source, those radiation protection standards established or enforced by the Department or who uses such radiation source in violation of law, regulation, this Article, order or license issued by the Department. Such person must decontaminate any premises which may have been contaminated with radioactive material as a result of any such activities to such radiation levels as the Department may specify. The expenses incidental to such transfer, surrender, and decontamination must be borne by such person responsible for the source.

In determining the extent of any individual's exposure to radiation subsequent to any radiation accident, contamination, theft or loss, the licensee must comply with all orders of the

Department directing such licensee to make available to such individual appropriate medical evaluation services or appropriate tests and to furnish a copy of the reports of such evaluation or test to the Department.

A licensee or applicant for a license must obtain any permits required by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to 6 NYCRR Part 380, or any successor law

or regulation, and must develop, document, and implement a discharge minimization program required by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to 6 NYCRR §380-7, or any successor law or regulation.

## §175.103General requirements for radioactive materials.

Except for the removal of source material from its place of origin in nature, or as otherwise may be provided in this Article, no person subject to this Article shall transfer, receive, produce, possess or use in New York City any radioactive material except pursuant to a license issued by the Department.
